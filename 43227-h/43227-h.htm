<p>The first edition seems to have fulfilled a need for a general
text-book on the subject of bacteriology. The original method
of presentation is preserved. The text-book idea is adhered to,
so that the individual instructor may have full liberty to expand
on topics in which he is especially interested. A number
of illustrations have been added, the text has been improved
in many instances by the addition of further explanatory
matter and the most recent general advances in the Science.
Examples are the System of Classification of the Society of
American Bacteriologists, which is used throughout the text,
their Key to the Genera of Bacteria, a discussion of the H-ion
concentration method of standardization, the selective action
of anilin dyes, the mechanism of entrance of pathogenic organisms
into the body, a more detailed explanation of the
origin of antibodies, the nature of antigens and a table of
antigens and antibodies.</p>

<p>Professor Vera McCoy Masters has assisted in the revision
by aiding in the preparation of manuscript and the reading
of proof and in the making of the index, for which services
the author’s thanks are hereby expressed.</p>

<h2 id="PREFACE_TO_FIRST_EDITION">PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION</h2>


<p>An experience of nearly twenty years in the teaching of
Bacteriology has convinced the author that students of this
subject need a comprehensive grasp of the entire field and
special training in fundamental technic before specializing
in any particular line of work. Courses at the University
are arranged on this basis. One semester is devoted to General
Bacteriology. During the second semester the student
has a choice of special work in Pathogenic, Dairy, Soil, Water,
or Chemical Bacteriology. A second year may be devoted
to advanced work in any of the above lines, to Immunity
and Serum Therapy, or to Pathogenic Protozoa.</p>

<p>This text-book is intended to cover the first or introductory
semester’s work, and requires two classroom periods per week.
Each student is compelled to take two laboratory periods
of three hours per week along with the class work. The outline
of the laboratory work is given at the end of the text.
Results attained seem to justify this plan. A text-book is
but one of many pedagogical mechanisms and is not intended
to be an encyclopedia of the subject.</p>

<p>The author makes no claim to originality of content, since
the facts presented are well known to every bacteriologist,
though the method of presentation is somewhat different from
texts in general. During the preparation of this work he
has made a thorough review of the literature of Bacteriology,
covering the standard text-books as well as works of reference
and the leading periodicals dealing with the subject. Thus
the latest information has been incorporated.</p>

<p>No attempt has been made to give detailed references in a
work of this character.</p>

<p><a id="Page_viii" class="pagenum" title="viii"> </a>
The photomicrographs are original except where otherwise
indicated and are all of a magnification of one thousand diameters
where no statement to the contrary appears. These
photographs were made with a Bausch &amp; Lomb Projection
Microscope fitted with a home-made camera box. Direct current
arc light was used and exposures were five to ten seconds.
Photographs of cultures are also original with a few indicated
exceptions. All temperatures are indicated in degrees centigrade.</p>

<p>For use of electrotypes or for prints furnished the author
is indebted to the following: A.&nbsp;P. Barber Creamery Supply
Company, Chicago, Ill.; Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Company,
Rochester, N.&nbsp;Y.; Creamery Package Manufacturing Company,
Chicago, Ill.; Davis Milk Machinery Company, North
Chicago, Ill.; Mr. C.&nbsp;B. Hoover, Superintendent of Sewage
Disposal Plant, Columbus, O.; Mr. C.&nbsp;P. Hoover, Superintendent
of Water Filtration Plant, Columbus, O.; The Hydraulic
Press Manufacturing Company, Mt. Gilead, O.; Loew
Manufacturing Company, Cleveland, O.; Metric Metal Works,
Erie, Pa.; Sprague Canning Machine Company, Chicago, Ill.;
U.&nbsp;S. Marine Hospital Service; Wallace and Tiernan Company,
New York City, N.&nbsp;Y.</p>

<p>For the preparation of many cultures and slides, for great
assistance in the reading of proof and in the preparation of
the index, Miss Vera M. McCoy, Instructor in Bacteriology,
deserves the author’s thanks.</p>

<p>The author trusts that the book will find a place in College
and University courses in Bacteriology.</p>

<h2>BACTERIOLOGY.</h2>


<hr />

<h3 id="HISTORICAL_INTRODUCTION">HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION.</h3>


<p>Bacteriology as a science is a development of the latter
half of the nineteenth century. It may be said to have
begun in the decade between 1870 and 1880, due largely
to the wide circulation given to Koch’s work in proving
that <i class="taxonomy">Bacillus anthracis</i> is the cause of Anthrax in 1876,
in devising new culture methods and in demonstrating that
wound infections are due to microörganisms, 1878. Associated
with this work were the great improvements in the
microscope by Abbé and the introduction of anilin dyes
for staining bacteria by Weigert. These results attracted
workers throughout the world to the “new science.” Nevertheless,
this work of Koch’s was preceded by numerous
observations and experiments which led up to it. Certainly
the most important discoveries immediately responsible
were those of Pasteur. He must be considered as the
greatest of the pioneer bacteriologists since he worked in
all fields of the subject. Some of the antecedent
work was done in attempting to disprove the old “spontaneous
generation” theory as to the origin of organisms;
some in searching for the causes of disease and some in the
study of fermentation and putrefaction.</p>


<h4 id="SPONTANEOUS_GENERATION">SPONTANEOUS GENERATION.</h4>

<p>Speculation as to the first origin of life is as old as history
and doubtless older. Every people of antiquity had its own
legends, as for example, the account in Genesis. This question
never can be definitely settled, even though living
matter should be made in the laboratory.</p>

<p><a id="Page_18" class="pagenum" title="18"> </a>
The doctrine of the “spontaneous origin” of particular
animals or plants from dead material under man’s own
observation is a somewhat different proposition and may be
subjected to experimental test. The old Greek philosophers
believed it. Anaximander (<span class="smaller">B.C.</span> 610&ndash;547) taught that some
animals are derived from moisture. Even Aristotle (<span class="smaller">B.C.</span>
384&ndash;322) said that “animals sometimes arise in soil, in
plants, or in other animals,” <i>i.e.</i>, spontaneously. It can be
stated that this belief was general from his day down through
the Dark and Middle Ages and later. Cardano (<span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1501&ndash;1576)
wrote that water gives rise to fish and animals and is
also the cause of fermentation. Van Helmont (1578&ndash;1644)
gives directions for making artificial mice. Kircher (1602&ndash;1680)
describes and figures animals <em>produced under his own
eyes</em> by water on plant stems.</p>

<p>However, many thinkers of the seventeenth century
doubted the truth of this long-established belief. Francesco
Redi (1626&ndash;1698) made a number of experiments which
tended to prove that maggots did not arise spontaneously
in meat, as was generally believed, but developed only when
flies had an opportunity to deposit their eggs on the meat.
It seems that by the latter part of this century the idea
that organisms large enough to be seen with the naked eye
could originate spontaneously was generally abandoned by
learned men.</p>

<p>The work of Leeuwenhoek served to suspend for a time
the subject of spontaneous generation, only to have it revived
more vigorously later on. He is usually called “The Father
of the Microscope,” though the compound microscope was
invented probably by Hans Zansz or his son Zacharias, of
Holland, about 1590. Leeuwenhoek used a simple lens, but
his instruments were so much more powerful that they
opened up an entirely new and unknown world. (<a href="#fig-1" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;1</a>.)</p>

<p>Anthony van Leeuwenhoek (1632&ndash;1723) was apprenticed
to a linen draper and accumulated a comfortable fortune
in this business. He became interested in the grinding of
spectacle lenses, then an important industry in Delft,
Holland, where he lived, and did a great deal of experimental
work in this line, mainly for his own enjoyment. Finally he
<a id="Page_19" class="pagenum" title="19"> </a>
succeeded in making a lens so powerful that he could see
in water and various infusions very minute living bodies
never before observed. Leeuwenhoek contributed 112 papers
to the Royal Society of Great Britain, the first in 1673,
many of them accompanied by such accurate descriptions
and drawings, for example a paper submitted September 12,
1683, that there is no doubt that he really saw bacteria and
was the first to do so (<a href="#fig-2" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;2</a>). Rightly may he be styled
“The Father of Bacteriology,” if not of the microscope. He
says in one paper: “With the greatest astonishment I
observed that everywhere through the material I was
examining were distributed <i class="term">animalcules</i> of the most microscopic
dimness which moved themselves about in a remarkably
energetic way.” Thus he considered these living
objects to be animals, from their motion, and this belief
held sway for nearly two hundred years.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;1.</span>&mdash;Leeuwenhoek’s Microscope. A is the simple bi-convex lens held
firmly in place. In front of this is the small table, B, with the support, C,
on the tip of which the object to be examined was held. This support could
be brought nearer to or removed further away from the lens and held firmly
in place by the screw, D.&nbsp;E is a second screw for raising or lowering the entire
table. A concave mirror that Leeuwenhoek sometimes used to focus more
light on the object under examination, is shown at the right.</div>
</div>

<p>Leeuwenhoek was a pure observer of facts and made no
attempt at speculation, but his discoveries soon started the
<a id="Page_20" class="pagenum" title="20"> </a>
theorists to discussing the origin of these minute organisms.
Most observers, as was probably to be expected, believed
that they arose spontaneously. Needham, in 1749, described
the development of microörganisms around grains of barley
in water. Bonnet, in 1768, suggested that probably Needham’s
animalcules came from ova in the liquid. The Abbot
Spallanzani, in 1769, called attention to the crudeness of
Needham’s methods and later, in 1776, attempted to disprove
spontaneous origin by heating infusions of organic
material in flasks and then <em>sealing</em> them. His critics raised
the objections that heating the liquids destroyed their
ability to support life, and that sealing prevented the access
of fresh air which was also necessary. The first objection
was disproved by the accidental cracking of some of the
flasks which thereafter showed an abundant growth. This
accident seemed also to support the second objection, and
Spallanzani did not answer it. Though Spallanzani’s experiments
failed to convince his opponents, they led to important
practical results, since François Appert, in 1810, applied
them to the preserving of fruits, meats, etc., and in a sense
started the modern canning industry.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;3.</span>&mdash;Schultze’s experiment. The set of bulbs next to the face contained
KOH and the other set concentrated H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Air was drawn through
at frequent intervals from May until August but no growth developed in
the boiled infusion.</div>
</div>

<p>From Spallanzani to Schultze, there were no further
experiments to prove or disprove spontaneous generation.
<a id="Page_21" class="pagenum" title="21"> </a>
Schultze, in 1836, attempted to meet the second objection
to Spallanzani’s experiment, <i>i.e.</i>, the exclusion of air, by
drawing air through his boiled infusions, first causing it to
bubble through concentrated sulphuric acid to kill the
“germs” (<a href="#fig-3" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;3</a>.). His flasks fortunately showed no
growths, but his critics claimed that the strong acid changed
the properties of the air so that it would not support life.
This experiment of Schultze’s, though devised for a different
purpose, was really the first <em>experiment</em> in the use of
<em>chemical disinfectants</em>, though Thaer (<a href="#Page_31" class="int-ref">page 31</a>) had used
chemicals in a practical way. Schwann, in 1837, modified
this experiment, by drawing the air through a tube heated
to destroy the living germs (<a href="#fig-4" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;4</a>). His experiments were
successful but the “spontaneous generation” theorists
raised the same objection, <i>i.e.</i>, the change in the air by heating.
This was the first <em>experiment</em> in which the principle
of “<em>dry heat</em>” or “<em>hot air</em>” sterilization was used. Similar
arguments were brought forward, also to the use of <em>cotton
plugs</em> as filters by Schroeder and Dusch in 1859 (<a href="#fig-5" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;5</a>).
This was the first use of the principle of <em>sterilization by filtration</em>.
It remained for Chevreuil and Pasteur to overcome
this objection in 1861 by the use of flasks with long necks
<a id="Page_22" class="pagenum" title="22"> </a>
drawn out to a point and bent over. These permitted a
full access of air by diffusion but kept out living germs,
<a id="Page_23"> </a>
<a id="Page_24" class="pagenum" title="24"> </a>
since these cannot fly but are carried mechanically by air
currents or fall of their own weight (<a href="#fig-6" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;6</a>.). Hoffman,
the year before (1860), had made similar experiments but
these remained unnoticed. The Pasteur flasks convinced
most scientists that “spontaneous generation” has never
been observed by man, though some few, notably Dr.
Charlton Bastian, of England, vigorously supported the
theory from the early seventies until his death in November,
1915.</p>

The bent tubes at the top are to permit a free circulation of air into the interior.
The window at the back has one corresponding in the front (removed).
Through these the beam of light sent through from the lamp at the side was
observed. The three tubes received the infusion and were then boiled in
an oil bath. The pipette was for filling the tubes. (Popular Science Monthly,
April, 1877.).</div>
</div>

<p>John Tyndall, in combating Bastian’s views showed that
boiled infusions left open to the air in a closed box through
which air circulated did not show any growth of organisms
provided the air was so free of particles that the path of a
ray of light sent through it from side to side could not be
seen (<a href="#fig-7" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;7</a>). Or if such sterilized infusions were exposed
to dust-free air, as in the high Alps, the majority showed no
growth, while all infusions in dusty air did show an abundance
of organisms. Tyndall’s experiments confirmed those
of Pasteur and his predecessors and showed that the organisms
developed from “germs” present in the air falling into
the liquids and not spontaneously.</p>

<p>While Tyndall’s experiments were of great value as indicated,
they probably were harmful in another way.
These “germs in the air” were considered by bacteriologists
as well as laymen to include necessarily many <i>disease germs</i>
and to indicate the very general, if not universal, presence
of these latter <em>in the air</em>. This idea led to many erroneous
practices in sanitation and disinfection which even to this
day are not eliminated.</p>


<h4 id="INTRO_CAUSATION_OF_DISEASE">CAUSATION OF DISEASE.</h4>

<p>The transmission of disease from person to person was
recognized by the ancients of European and Asiatic countries.
Inoculation of smallpox was practiced in China and
India probably several thousand years ago and was introduced
by Lady Mary Wortley Montague into England in
1721, from Constantinople. These beliefs and practices do
not seem to have been associated with any speculations or
theories as to the cause of the disease.</p>

<p><a id="Page_25" class="pagenum" title="25"> </a>
Apparently the first writer on this subject was Varo, about
<span class="smaller">B.C.</span> 70, who suggested that fevers in swampy places were
due to invisible organisms. The treatment of wounds during
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries by hot wine
fomentations and by the application of plasters was based
on the theory that the <em>air</em> brought about conditions in the
wounds which led to suppuration. These practices were
indeed primitive antisepsis, yet were not based on a <i>germ
theory</i> of the conditions which were partially prevented.
Fracastorius (1484&ndash;1553), in a work published in 1546,
elaborated a theory of “disease germs” and “direct and indirect
contagion” very similar to modern views, though
based on no direct pathological knowledge. Nevertheless
Kircher (mentioned already) is usually given undeserved
credit for the “contagium vivum” theory. In 1657 by the
use of simple lenses he observed “worms” in decaying substances,
in blood and in the pus from bubonic plague patients
(probably rouleaux of corpuscles in the blood, certainly not
bacteria in any case). Based on these observations and
possibly also on reading the work of Fracastorius, his theory
of a “living cause” for various diseases was published in
1671, but received little support.</p>

<p>The discoveries of Leeuwenhoek which proved the existence
of microscopic organisms soon revived the “contagium
vivum” idea of Kircher. Nicolas Andry in a work published
in 1701 upheld this view. Lancisi in 1718 advanced
the idea that “animalcules” were responsible for malaria, a
view not proved until Laveran discovered the malarial parasite
in 1880.<a id="Marker_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="marker" title="Footnote 1">1</a> Physicians ascribed the plague which visited
Southern France in 1721 to the same cause, and many even
went so far as to attribute all disease to animalcules, which
brought the theory into ridicule. Nevertheless the “contagium
vivum” theory survived, and even Linnaeus in his
<cite>Systema Naturæ</cite> (1753&ndash;6) recognized it by placing the
organisms of Leeuwenhoek, the contagia of diseases and the
causes of putrefaction and fermentation in one class called
“Chaos.”</p>

<p><a id="Page_26" class="pagenum" title="26"> </a>
Plenciz, a prominent physician and professor in the Vienna
Medical School, published in 1762 a work in which he gave
strong arguments for the “living cause” theory for transmissable
diseases. He taught that the agent is evidently
transmitted through the air and that there is a certain
period of incubation pointing to a multiplication within the
body. He also believed that there was a specific agent
for each disease. His writings attracted little attention at
the time and the “contagium vivum” theory seems to have
been almost lost sight of for more than fifty years. Indeed,
Oznam, in 1820, said it was no use to waste time in refuting
hypotheses as to the animal nature of contagium.</p>

<p>Isolated observers, were, however, keeping the idea alive,
each in his own locality. In 1787 Wollstein, of Vienna,
showed that the pus from horses with glanders could infect
other horses if inoculated into the skin. Abilgaard, of
Copenhagen, made similar experiments at about the same
time. In 1797 Eric Viborg, a pupil of Abilgaard’s, published
experiments in which he showed the infectious nature not
only of the pus but also of the nasal discharges, saliva,
urine, etc., of glandered horses. Jenner in 1795&ndash;98 introduced
vaccination as a method of preventing smallpox. This
epoch-making discovery attracted world wide attention and
led to the overcoming of this scourge which had devastated <!--TN: was 'devasted'-->
Europe for centuries, but contributed little or nothing to
the question of the causation of disease. Prevost’s discovery
of the cause of grain rust (<i class="taxonomy">Puccinia graminis</i>) in 1807 was
the <em>first instance of an infectious disease of plants</em> shown to
be <em>due to a microscopic plant organism</em>, though not a bacterium
in this case.</p>

<p>Doubtless one reason why the work on glanders and grain
rust attracted little attention among the practitioners of
human medicine was owing to the prevalent belief in man’s
complete separation from all lower forms of life. The
evolutionists had not yet paved the way for experimental
medicine.</p>

<p>In 1822 Gaspard showed the poisonous nature of material
from infected wounds by injecting it into animals and causing
their death. Tiedemann (1822), Peacock (1828) described
<a id="Page_27" class="pagenum" title="27"> </a>
“little bodies” in the muscles of human cadavers
which Hilton (1832) considered to be parasitic in nature.
Paget (1835) showed that these bodies were round worms
and Owen (1835) described them more accurately and gave
the name <i class="taxonomy">Trichina spiralis</i> to them. Leidy (1846) found
organisms in the muscles of hogs which he considered to be
the same as Owen’s Trichina and paved the way for the
work of Zenker (1860) in showing the pathological relation
between the Trichina of pork and human Trichinosis.
Bearing on the “contagium vivum” theory was the rediscovery
of the “itch mite” (<i class="taxonomy">Sarcoptes scabiei</i>) by Renucci
(1834), an Italian medical student. This had been declared
several hundred years before but had been lost sight of.
Chevreuil and Pasteur, in 1836, showed that putrefaction
did not occur in meat protected from contamination, and
suggested that wound infection probably resulted from entrance
of germs from without. Bassi, investigating a disease
of silkworms in Italy, demonstrated that a certain
mold-like fungus (<i class="taxonomy">Botrytis bassiana</i>) was the cause in 1837.
This was the <em>first instance of a microscopic vegetable organism</em>
proved to be capable of <em>causing disease in an animal</em>.</p>

<p>Boehm, in 1838, observed minute organisms in the stools
of cholera patients and conjectured that they might have a
causal connection with the disease. Dubini of Milan in
1838 discovered the <i class="taxonomy">Ankylostoma duodenale</i> which later was
further described by Omodei in 1843 and shown to be the
cause of Egyptian chlorosis by Griesinger (1851). The
fungous nature of favus, a scalp disease, was recognized
by Schönlein in 1839, and the organism was afterward called
“<i class="taxonomy">Achorion schoenleinii</i>.” Berg, in 1839&ndash;41, showed that
thrush is likewise due to a fungus, “<i class="taxonomy">Oidium albicans</i>.”</p>

<p>These discoveries led Henle, in 1840, to publish a work in
which he maintained that all contagious diseases must be
due to living organisms, and to propound certain postulates
(afterward restated by Koch and now known as “Koch’s
postulates” <a href="#Page_233" class="int-ref">p.&nbsp;233</a>) which must be demonstrated before one
can be sure that a given organism is the specific cause of a
given disease. The methods then in vogue and the instruments
of that period did not enable Henle to prove his
<a id="Page_28" class="pagenum" title="28"> </a>
claims, but he must be given the credit for establishing the
“contagium vivum” theory on a good basis and pointing
the way for men better equipped to prove its soundness in
after years.</p>

<p>In 1842&ndash;43 Gruby showed that Herpes tonsurans, a form
of ringworm, is due to the fungus <i class="taxonomy">Trichophyton tonsurans</i>.
Klencke, in 1843, produced generalized tuberculosis in a
rabbit by injecting tuberculous material into a vein in the
ear, but did not carry his researches further. In 1843,
Doctor Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote a paper in which he
contended that puerperal fever was contagious. Liebert
identified the <i class="taxonomy">Peronospora infestans</i> as the cause of one type
of potato rot in 1845. The skin disease Pityriasis (tinea)
versicolor was shown to be due to the <i class="taxonomy">Microsporon furfur</i>
by Eichstedt in 1846. In 1847 Semmelweiss of Vienna
recommended disinfection of the hands with chloride of
lime by obstetricians because he believed with Holmes in
the transmissibility of puerperal fever through poisons carried
in this way from the dissecting room but his theories
were ridiculed.</p>

<p>Pollender, in 1849, and Davaine and Rayer, in 1850, independently
observed small rod-like bodies in the blood of
sheep and cattle which had died of splenic fever (anthrax).
That Egyptian chlorosis, afterward identified with Old
World “hookworm disease,” is caused by the <i class="taxonomy">Ankylostoma
duodenale</i> was shown by Greisinger in 1851. In the same
year the <i class="taxonomy">Schistosomum hematobium</i> was shown to be the
cause of the “Bilharzia disease” by Bilharz. Küchenmeister
discovered the tapeworm, <i class="taxonomy">Tænia solium</i>, in 1852,
Cohn, an infectious disease of flies due to a parasitic fungus
(<i class="taxonomy">Empusa muscæ</i>) in 1855, and Zenker showed the connection
between trichinosis of pork (“measly pork”) and human
trichinosis (1860) as indicated above. The organisms just
mentioned are, of course, not bacteria, but these discoveries
proved conclusively that <em>living things of one kind or another,
some large, most of them microscopic, could cause disease in
other organisms</em> and stimulated the search for other “living
contagiums.” In 1863 Davaine, already mentioned, showed
that anthrax could be transmitted from animal to animal
<a id="Page_29" class="pagenum" title="29"> </a>
by inoculation of blood, but only if the blood contained the
minute rods which he believed to be the cause. Davaine
later abandoned this belief because he transmitted the
disease with old blood in which he could find no rods. It is
now known that this was because the bacilli were in the
“spore” form which Davaine did not recognize. He thus
missed the definite proof of the bacterial nature of anthrax
because he was not familiar with the life history of the
organism which was worked out by Koch thirteen years
later. In 1865 Villemin repeatedly caused tuberculosis in
rabbits by subcutaneous injection of tuberculous material
and showed that this disease must be infectious also. In
the same year Lord Lister introduced antiseptic methods
in surgery. He believed that wound infections were due
to microörganisms getting in from the air, the surgeon’s
fingers, etc., and without proving this, he used carbolic acid
to kill these germs and prevent the infection. His pioneer
experiments made modern surgery possible. In this year
also, Pasteur was sent to investigate a disease, Pebrine,
which was destroying the silkworms in Southern France.
He showed the cause to be a protozoan which had been seen
previously by Cornalia and described by Nägeli under the
name <i class="taxonomy">Nosema bombycis</i> and devised preventive measures.
This was the <em>first infectious disease</em> shown to be <em>due to a protozoan</em>.
In 1866 Rindfleisch observed small pin-point-like
bodies in the heart muscle of persons who had died of wound
infection. Klebs, in 1870&ndash;71, published descriptions and
names of organisms he had found in the material from similar
wounds, though he did not establish their causal relation.
Bollinger, in 1872, discovered the spores of anthrax
and explained the persistence of the disease in certain districts
as due to the resistant spores. In 1873 Obermeier
observed in the blood of patients suffering from recurrent
fever long, flexible spiral organisms which have been named
<i class="taxonomy">Spirochæta obermeieri</i>. Lösch ascribed tropical dysentery
to an ameba, named by him <i class="taxonomy">Amœba coli</i>, in 1875. Finally,
Koch, in 1876, isolated the anthrax bacillus, worked out the
life history of the organism and reproduced the disease by
the injection of pure cultures and recovered the organism
<a id="Page_30" class="pagenum" title="30"> </a>
from the inoculated animals, thus establishing beyond
reasonable doubt its causal relationship to the disease.
This was the <em>first instance of a bacterium</em> proved to be the
cause of a <em>disease in animals</em>. Pasteur, working on the
disease at the same time, confirmed all of Koch’s findings,
though his results were published the next year, 1877.
Bollinger determined that the <i class="taxonomy">Actinomyces bovis</i> (<i class="taxonomy">Streptothrix
bovis</i>) is the cause of actinomycosis in cattle in 1877.
Woronin in the same year discovered a protozoan (<i class="taxonomy">Plasmodiophora
brassicæ</i>) to be the cause of a disease in cabbage,<!--TN: added comma-->
the <em>first proved instance of a unicellular animal causing a
disease in a plant</em>. In 1878 Koch published his researches
on wound infection in which he showed beyond question
that microörganisms are the cause of this condition, though
Pasteur in 1837, had suggested the same thing and Lister
had acted on the theory in preventing infection.</p>

<p>These discoveries, especially those of Koch, immediately
attracted world-wide attention and stimulated a host of
workers, so that within the next ten years most of the bacteria
which produce disease in men and animals were isolated
and described. It is well to remember that the first
<em>specific</em> disease of man proved to be caused by a <em>bacterium</em>
was <em>tuberculosis</em>, by Koch in 1882.</p>

<p>Progress was greatly assisted by the introduction of anilin
dyes as suitable stains for organisms by Weigert in 1877, by
Koch’s application of special technic and gelatin cultures
for isolation and study, 1881, and the great improvements
in the microscope by Prof. Abbé, of Jena.</p>

<p>Laveran’s discovery of the malarial parasite in 1880
turned attention to protozoa as the causes of disease and led
to the discovery of the various piroplasmoses and trypanosomiases
in man and the lower animals.</p>

<p>Pasteur’s protective inoculations in chicken cholera and
anthrax directed attention to the possibility of using bacteria
or their products as a specific protective or curative
means against particular diseases. This finally led to the
discovery of diphtheria antitoxin by Behring, and independently
by Roux, in 1890, a discovery which opened up the
wide field of immunity which is so persistently cultivated at
the present time.</p>

While the causation of disease by bacteria has probably
attracted most attention, especially in the popular mind, it
should not be forgotten that this is but one of the numerous
ways in which these organisms manifest their activities, and
in a sense it is one of their least-important ways, since other
kinds are essential in many industries (dairying, agriculture)
and processes (sewage purification) and are even <em>indispensable
for the very existence of all green plants and hence of
animals, including man himself</em>.</p>


<h4 id="PUTREFACTION_AND_FERMENTATION">PUTREFACTION AND FERMENTATION.</h4>

<p>The idea that there is a certain resemblance between
some infectious diseases and the processes of putrefaction
and fermentation seems to have originated during the discussion
on spontaneous generation and the “contagium
vivum” theory which followed Leeuwenhoek’s discoveries.
Plenciz (1762) appears to have first formulated this belief
in writing. He considered putrefaction to be due to the
“animalcules” and said that it occurred only when there
was a coat of organisms on the material and only when
they increased and multiplied. Spallanzani’s experiments
tended to support this view since his infusions did not “spoil”
when boiled and sealed. Appert’s practical application
of this idea has been mentioned.</p>

<p>Thaer, in his <cite>Principles of Rational Agriculture</cite>, published
in the first quarter of the nineteenth century, expressed
the belief that the “blue milk fermentation” was probably
due to a kind of fungus that gets in from the air, and stated
that he had prevented it by treating the milk cellars and
vessels, with sulphur fumes or with “oxygenated hydrochloric
acid” (hypochlorous acid).</p>

<p>In 1836 Chevreuil and Pasteur showed that putrefaction
did not occur in meat protected from contamination. In
1837 Caignard-Latour, in France, and Schwann, in Germany,
independently showed that alcoholic fermentation in beer
and wine is due to the growth of a microscopic plant, the
yeast, in the fermenting wort. C.&nbsp;J. Fuchs described the
organism which is commonly called the “blue milk bacillus”
<a id="Page_32" class="pagenum" title="32"> </a>
in 1841 and conjectured that the souring of milk was probably
bacterial in origin. It remained for Pasteur to prove
this in 1857. During the following six or seven years Pasteur
also proved that acetic acid fermentation, as in vinegar
making, butyric acid fermentation (odor of rancid butter
and old cheese) and the ammoniacal fermentation of urea,
so noticeable around stables, were each due to different
species of bacteria. Pasteur also, during the progress of this
work, discovered the class of organisms which can grow in
the absence of free oxygen&mdash;the anaërobic bacteria. There
is no question that Pasteur from 1857 on did more to lay the
foundations of the science of bacteriology than any other
one man. Influenced by Pasteur’s work von Hesseling, in
1866, stated his belief that the process of cheese ripening,
like the souring of milk, was associated with the growth of
fungi, and Martin also, in 1867, stated that cheese ripening
was a process which was akin to alcoholic, lactic and butyric<!--TN: was 'butryic'-->
fermentations. Kette, in 1869, asserted the probability of
Pasteur’s researches furnishing a scientific basis for many
processes of change in the soil. In 1873 Schlösing and
Müntz showed that nitrification must be due to the action
of microörganisms, though the discovery of the particular
ones remained for Winogradsky in 1889. Thus the belief
that fermentation and putrefaction are due to microörganisms
was as well established by the early eighties of the last
century as that similar organisms are the causes of infectious
diseases.</p>


<h4 id="STUDY_OF_FORMS">STUDY OF FORMS.</h4>

<p>An important part of the scientific knowledge of living
organisms is dependent on a study of their forms and relationships.
As has been stated, Leeuwenhoek considered
bacteria to be “animalcules” because they showed independent
movement. But little attention was paid to the
natural history of these animalcules for nearly a hundred
years after Leeuwenhoek. During the last quarter of the
eighteenth century, however, workers<!--TN: deleted extra comma--> busied themselves
chiefly with the discovery and description of new forms.
Among these students were Baron Gleichen, Jablot, Lesser,
<a id="Page_33" class="pagenum" title="33"> </a>
Reaumur, Hill and others. Müller, of Copenhagen, in 1786
published the first attempt at classification, a most important
step in the study of these organisms. Müller introduced
the terms Monas, Proteus and Vibrio, which are
still in use. Ehrenberg, in his work on <i class="term">Infusoria</i>, or the
organisms found in infusions, published in 1838, introduced
many generic names in use at present, but still classed the
bacteria with protozoa. Joseph Leidy, the American naturalist,
considered that the “vibrios” of previous writers were
plants and not “animalcules.” He seems to have been the
first to have made this distinction (1849). Perty (1852)
recognized the presence of spores in some of his organisms.
Ferdinand Cohn (1854) classed the bacteria among plants.
Nägeli (1857) proposed the name “Schizomycetes” or
“fission fungi,” which is still retained for the entire class of
bacteria. Cohn in the years 1872&ndash;1875 established classification
on a modern basis and added greatly to the knowledge
of morphology and natural history of bacteria. He described
spore formation and the development of spores into
active bacteria, and showed the close relationships as well
as differences between the bacteria and the lower algæ.
Robert Koch was a pupil of Cohn.</p>

<p>Bacteria are considered to belong to the plant kingdom
not because of any one character they possess, but because
they most nearly resemble organisms which are generally
recognized as plants. While it is not difficult to distinguish
between the higher plants and higher animals, it becomes
almost, if not quite, impossible to separate the lowest, forms
of life. It is only by the method of resemblances above
mentioned that a decision is finally reached. It has even
been proposed to make a third class of organisms neither
plants nor animals but midway between in which the bacteria
are included, but such a classification has not as yet
been adopted.</p>

<p>In many respects the bacteria are most nearly related to
the lowest <i>algæ</i>, since both are unicellular organisms, both
reproduce by transverse division and the forms of the cell
are strikingly similar. The bacteria differ in one important
respect, that is, they do not contain <i class="term">chlorophyl</i>, the green
coloring matter which enables all plants possessing it to
absorb and break up carbon dioxide in the light, and hence
belong among the fungi. Bacteria average much smaller
than even the smallest algæ.</p>

<p>Bacteria are closely connected with the <i class="term">fission yeasts</i> and
the <i class="term">yeasts</i> and <i class="term">torulæ</i>. All are unicellular and without
chlorophyl. The bacteria, as has been stated, reproduce
by division but the others characteristically by budding or
gemmation, though the fission yeasts also by division.</p>

<p>There is a certain resemblance to the <i class="term">molds</i> in their
absence of chlorophyl. But the molds grow as branching
threads and also have special fruiting organs for producing
spores as a means of reproduction, neither of which characteristics
is found among the <em>true</em> bacteria. The higher
<a id="Page_38" class="pagenum" title="38"> </a>
thread bacteria do show true branching and rudimentary
fruiting bodies (Streptothrix) and appear to be a link connecting
the true bacteria and the molds.</p>

<p>The food of bacteria is always taken up in solution by
diffusion through the outer covering of the cell as it is in all
plants. Plant cells never surround and engulf particles of
solid food and digest them within the cell as many single-celled
animals do, and as the leukocytes and similar ameboid
cells in practically all multicelled animals do.<a id="Marker_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="marker" title="Footnote 2">2</a></p>

the branching.</div>
</div>

<p>One of the most marked differences between animals and
plants is with respect to their energy relationships. Plants
are characteristically storers of energy while animals are
liberators of it. Some bacteria which have the power of
<a id="Page_40" class="pagenum" title="40"> </a>
swimming in a liquid certainly liberate relatively large
amounts of energy, and in the changes which bacteria bring
about in the material which they use as food considerable
heat is evolved (“heating” of manure, etc.). Nevertheless
the evidence is good that the bacteria as a class store much
more of the energy contained in the substances actually
taken into the body cell as food than is liberated in any
form.</p>

<p>Bacteria do show some resemblance to the protozoa, or
single-celled animal forms, in that the individuals of each
group consist of one cell only and some bacteria have the
power of independent motion from place to place in a liquid
as most “infusoria” do, but here the resemblance ceases.</p>

<p>Bacteria are among the smallest of organisms, so small
that it requires the highest powers of the microscope for
their successful study, and the use of a special unit for their
measurement. This unit is the one-thousandth part of a
millimeter and is called the micro-millimeter or micron.
Its symbol is the Greek letter <i>mu</i> (µ).</p>

<p>The size varies widely among different kinds but is fairly
constant in the same kind. The smallest described form is
said to be only 0.18µ long by 0.06µ thick and is just visible
with the highest power of the microscope, though it is possible
and even probable that there are forms still smaller
which cannot be seen. Some large rare forms may measure
40µ in length, but the vast majority are from 1µ to 4µ or 5µ
long, and from one-third to one-half as wide.</p>

<p>From the above description a bacterium might be said to
be a <em>microscopic, unicellular plant, without chlorophyl, which
reproduces by dividing transversely</em>.</p>

CELL STRUCTURES.</h3>


<p>The <em>essential</em> structures which may by appropriate means
be distinguished in the bacterial cell are <i class="term">cell wall</i> and <i class="term">cell
contents</i>, technically termed <i class="term">protoplasm</i>, cytoplasm. The
cell wall is not so dense, relatively, as that of green plants,
but is thicker than the outer covering of protozoa. It is
very similar to the cell wall of other lower fungi. Diffusion
takes place readily through it with very little selective action
on substances absorbed as judged by the comparative composition
of bacteria and their surrounding medium.</p>

<p><b>Cytoplasm.</b>&mdash;The cytoplasm according to Bütschli and
others is somewhat different and slightly denser in its outer
portion next to the cell wall. This layer is designated the
<i class="term">ectoplasm</i>, as distinguished from the remainder of the cell
contents, the <i class="term">endoplasm</i>. When bacteria are suddenly transferred
from a given medium into one of decidedly <em>greater</em>
density, there sometimes results a contraction of the <i class="term">endoplasm</i>,
due to the rapid diffusion of water. This phenomenon
is designated <i class="term">plasmolysis</i> (<a href="#fig-17" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;17</a>), and is similar to what
occurs in the cells of higher plants when subjected to the
same treatment. This is one of the methods which may be
used to show the different parts of the cell just described.</p>

<p>If bacteria are suddenly transferred from a relatively
dense medium to one which is of decidedly <em>less</em> density, it
<a id="Page_42" class="pagenum" title="42"> </a>
occasionally happens that water diffuses into the cell and
swells up the endoplasm so much more rapidly than the cell
wall that the latter ruptures and some of the endoplasm
exudes in the form of droplets on the surface of the cell
wall. This phenomenon is called <i class="term">plasmoptysis</i>. Students
will seldom observe the distinction between cell wall and cell
contents, except that in examining living bacteria the outer
portion appears more highly refractive. This is chiefly due
to the presence of a cell wall, but is not a proof of its existence.</p>

<p><b>Nucleus.</b>&mdash;Douglas and Distaso<a id="Marker_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="marker" title="Footnote 3">3</a> summarize the various
opinions with regard to the nucleus in bacteria as follows:</p>

<p>1. Those who do not admit, the presence of a nucleus or of
anything equivalent to it. (Fischer, Migula, Massart).</p>

<p>2. Those who consider that the entire bacterial cell is the
equivalent of a nucleus and contains no protoplasm. (Ruzicka).</p>

<p>3. Those who admit the presence of nuclein but say that
this is not morphologically differentiated from the protoplasm
as a nucleus. (Weigert).</p>

<p><a id="Page_43" class="pagenum" title="43"> </a>
4. Those who consider the bacterial protoplasm to consist
of a central endoplasm throughout which the nuclein
is diffused and an external layer of ectoplasm next to the
cell wall. (Bütschli, Zettnow).</p>

<p>5. Those who say that the bacterial cell contains a distinct
nucleus, at least in most instances. These authors
base their claims on staining with a Giemsa stain. (Feinberg,
Ziemann, Neuvel, Dobell, Douglass and Distaso).</p>

<p>That nucleoproteins are present in the bacterial cell in
relatively large amounts is well established. Also that
there are other proteins and that the protoplasm is not all
nuclein.</p>

<p>Some workers as noted above have been able to demonstrate
collections of nuclein by staining, especially in very
young cells. In older cells this material is in most instances
diffused throughout the protoplasm and can not be so
differentiated.</p>

<p>The following statement probably represents the generally
accepted view at the present time:</p>

<p>A nucleus <em>as such</em> is not present in bacterial cells, except in
a few large rare forms and in very young cells. <i class="term">Nuclein</i>, the
characteristic chemical substance in nuclei, which when
aggregated forms the nucleus, is scattered throughout
the cell contents and thus intimately mingled with the
protoplasm, and cannot be differentiated by staining as in
most cells.</p>

<p>The close association of nuclein and protoplasm may explain
the rapid rate of division of bacteria (Chapter VIII,
<a href="#Page_91" class="int-ref">p.&nbsp;91</a>).</p>

<p>The chemical composition of the bacterial cell is discussed
in <a href="#CHAPTER_VII" class="int-ref">Chapter VII</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to the <em>essential</em> parts just described the bacterial
cell may show some of the following <em>accidental</em> structures:
<i class="term">vacuoles</i>, <i class="term">capsules</i>, <i class="term">metachromatic granules</i>, <i class="term">flagella</i>,
<i class="term">spores</i>.</p>

<p><b>Vacuoles.</b>&mdash;<i class="term">Vacuoles</i> appear as clear spaces in the protoplasm
when the organism is examined in the living condition
or when stained very slightly (<a href="#fig-18" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;18</a>). During life these
are filled with liquid or gaseous material which is sometimes
<a id="Page_44" class="pagenum" title="44"> </a>
waste, sometimes reserve food, sometimes digestive fluids.
Students are apt to confuse vacuoles with spores (<a href="#Page_47" class="int-ref">p.&nbsp;47</a>).
Staining is the surest way to differentiate (Chapter XIX,
<a href="#Page_209" class="int-ref">p.&nbsp;209</a>). If vacuoles have any special function, it is an
unimportant one.</p>

spots are the granules. The cells
of the bacteria are scarcely visible.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><b>Capsule.</b>&mdash;The <i class="term">capsule</i> is a second covering outside the cell
wall and probably developed from it (<a href="#fig-19" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;19</a>). It is usually
gelatinous, so that bacteria which form capsules frequently
stick together when growing in a fluid, so that the whole
mass has a jelly-like consistency. The term <i class="term">zoöglœa</i> was
formerly applied to such masses, but it is a poor term and
misleading (zoön&nbsp;=&nbsp;an animal) and should be dropped. The
masses of jelly-like material frequently found on decaying
wood, especially in rainy weather, are in some cases masses
of capsule-forming bacteria, though a part of the jelly is a
product of bacterial activity, a gum-like substance which
lies among the capsulated organisms. When these masses
dry out, they become tough and leathery, but it is not to be
presumed that capsules are of this consistency. On the
contrary, they are soft and delicate, though they certainly
serve as an additional protection to the organism, doubtless
more by selective absorption than mechanically. Certain
bacteria which cause disease form capsules in the blood of
those animals which they kill and not in the blood of those
in which they have no effect (<i class="taxonomy">Bacterium anthracis</i> in guinea
<a id="Page_45" class="pagenum" title="45"> </a>
pig’s blood and in rat’s blood). The presence of capsules
around an organism can be proved only by staining the
capsule. Many bacteria when stained in albuminous fluids
show a clear space around them which appears like a capsule.
It is due to the contraction of the fluid away from the
organism during drying.</p>

<p><b>Metachromatic Granules.</b>&mdash;The term “<i class="term">metachromatic</i>” is
applied to granules which in stained preparations take a
color different from the protoplasm as a whole (<a href="#fig-20" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;20</a>).
They vary widely in chemical composition. Some of them
are glycogen, some fat droplets. Others are so-called “granulose”
closely related to starch but probably not true
starch. Others are probably nuclein. Of many the chemical
composition is unknown. They are called “Babes-Ernst
corpuscles” in certain bacteria (typhoid bacillus).
Since they frequently occur in the ends of cells the term
“polar granules” is also applied. Their presence is of
value in the recognition of but few bacteria (“Neisser granules”
in diphtheria).</p>

<p><b>Flagellum.</b>&mdash;A <i class="term">flagellum</i> is a very minute thread-like process
growing out from the cell wall, probably filled with a
strand of protoplasm. The vibrations of the flagella move
the organism through the liquid medium. Bacteria which
are thus capable of independent movement are spoken of
as “motile bacteria.” The actual rate of movement is very
slight, though in proportion to the size of the organism it
may be considered rapid. Thus Alfred Fischer determined
that some organisms have a speed for short periods of about
40&nbsp;cm. per hour. This is equivalent to a man moving more
than 200 miles in the same time.</p>

<p>It is obvious that bacteria which can move about in a
liquid have an advantage in obtaining food, since they do
not need to wait for it to be brought to them. This advantage
is probably slight.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;22.</span>&mdash;A bacterium showing
a bundle of four flagella at the end&mdash;lophotrichic.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>An organism may have only one flagellum at the end. It
is then said to be monotrichic (<a href="#fig-21" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;21</a>) (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">μόνος</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;alone, single;
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τριχος</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;hair). This is most commonly at the front end, so
that the bacterium is drawn through the liquid by its motion.
Rarely it is at the rear end. Other bacteria may possess a
<a id="Page_46" class="pagenum" title="46"> </a>
bundle of flagella at one end and are called <i class="term">lophotrichic</i> (<a href="#fig-22" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;22</a>)
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λοφος</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;tuft). Sometimes at approaching division the
flagella may be at both ends and are then <i class="term">amphitrichic</i> (<a href="#fig-23" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;23</a>)
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αμφι</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;both). It is probable that this condition does
not persist long, but represents the development of flagella
at one end of each of a pair resulting from division of an
organism which has flagella at one end only. In many
bacteria the flagella arise from all parts of the surface of the
cell. Such bacteria are <i class="term">peritrichic</i> (<a href="#fig-24" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;24</a>) (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">περι</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;around).
The position and even the number of the flagella are very
constant for each kind and are of decided value in identification.</p>

<p><a id="Page_47" class="pagenum" title="47"> </a>
Flagella are too fine and delicate to be seen on the living
organism, or even on bacteria which have been colored by
the ordinary stains. They are rendered visible only by
certain methods which cause a precipitate on both bacteria
and flagella which are thereby made thick enough to be
seen (Chapter XIX, <a href="#Page_210" class="int-ref">p.&nbsp;210</a>). The movement of liquid
around a bacterium caused by vibrations of flagella can
sometimes be observed with large forms and the use of
“dark-field” illumination.</p>

<p>Flagella are very delicate and easily broken off from the
cell body. Slight changes in the density or reaction of the
medium frequently cause this breaking off, so that preparations
made from actively motile bacteria frequently show
no flagella. For this reason and also on account of their
fineness the demonstration of flagella is not easy, and it is
not safe to say that a non-motile bacterium has no flagella
except after very careful study.</p>

<p>The motion of bacteria is characteristic and a little practice
in observing will enable the student to recognize it and
distinguish between motility and “Brownian” or molecular
motion. Dead and non-motile bacteria show the latter.
In fact, any finely divided particles suspended in a liquid
which is not too viscous and in which the particles are not
soluble show Brownian motion or “pedesis.” This latter is
a dancing motion of the particle within a very small area
and without change of place, while motile bacteria move
from place to place or even out of the field of the microscope
with greater or less speed. There is a marked difference in
the character of the motion of different kinds of bacteria.
Some rotate around the long axis when moving, others
vibrate from side to side.</p>

<p>Among the higher thread bacteria there are some which
show motility without possessing flagella. Just how they
move is little understood.</p>

<p><b>Spores.</b>&mdash;Under certain conditions some bacterial cells
undergo transformations which result in the formation of
so-called <i class="term">spores</i>. If the process is followed under the microscope,
the changes observed are approximately these: A
very minute point appears in the protoplasm which seems to
<a id="Page_48" class="pagenum" title="48"> </a>
act somewhat like the centrosome of higher cells as a “center
of attraction” so that the protoplasm gradually collects
around it. The spot disappears or is enclosed in the collected
protoplasm. This has evidently become denser as it
is more highly refractive than before. In time all or nearly
all of the protoplasm is collected. A new cell wall is developed
around it which is thicker than the cell wall of the
bacterium. This thickened cell wall is called the “spore
capsule.” Gradually the remnants of the former cell contents
and the old cell wall disappear or dissolve and the
spore becomes “free” (<a href="#fig-25" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;25</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig-25">
<img src="images/fig-25.jpg" width="203" height="200" alt="" /><br />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;25.</span>&mdash;The smaller oval bodies in the middle of the field are free spores.</div>
</div>

<p>If the spore is placed in favorable conditions the protoplasm
absorbs water, swells, the capsule bursts at some
point, a cell wall is formed and the bacterium grows to
normal size and divides, that is, it is an active growing cell
again. This process is called “germination” of the spore.
The point at which the spore capsule bursts to permit the
new cell to emerge is characteristic for each kind of bacterium.
It may be at the end when the germination is said
to be <i class="term">polar</i> (<a href="#fig-26" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;26</a>). It may be from the middle of one
side which gives <i>equatorial</i> germination (<a href="#fig-27" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;27</a>). Rarely it
is diagonally from a point between the equator and the pole,
which type may be styled <i class="term">oblique</i> germination. In one or
two instances the entire spore swells up, lengthens and
becomes a rod without any special germination unless this
type might be designated <i class="term">bi-polar</i>.</p>

middle of the organism without (<a href="#fig-28" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;28</a>) or with (<a href="#fig-29" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;29</a>)
a change in size of the cell around it. If the diameter
through the cell is increased, then the cell with the contained
spore becomes spindle-shaped. Such a cell is termed
a “<i class="term">clostridium</i>.” Sometimes the spore develops in the end
of the cell either without (<a href="#fig-30" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;30</a>) or with enlarging it
(<a href="#fig-31" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;31</a>). In a few forms the spore is placed at the end of
the rod and shows a marked enlargement. This is spoken
of as the “<i class="term">plectridium</i>” or more commonly the “drumstick
spore” (<a href="#fig-32" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;32</a>). The position and shape of the spore are
<a id="Page_50" class="pagenum" title="50"> </a>
constant for each kind of bacteria. In one or two instances
only, two spores have been observed in a single organism.</p>

<p>The fact that the protoplasm is denser and the spore capsule
thicker (the percentage of water in each is decidedly
less than in the growing cell) gives the spore the property
of much greater resistance to all destructive agencies than
the active bacterium has. For example, all actively growing
cells are destroyed by boiling in a very few minutes, while
some spores require several hours’ boiling. The same relation
holds with regard to drying, the action of chemicals,
light, etc. That the coagulation temperature of a protein
varies inversely with the amount of water, it contains, is
shown by the following table from Frost and McCampbell,
“General Bacteriology”:</p>

<p>This resistance explains why it happens that food materials
boiled and sealed in cans to prevent the entrance of organisms
sometimes spoil. The spores have not been killed by
the boiling. It explains also in part the persistence of some
diseases like anthrax and black leg in pastures for years.
From the above description it follows that the spore is to
be considered as <em>a condensation of the bacterial protoplasm
surrounded by an especially thick cell wall</em>. <em>Its function is
the preservation of the organism under adverse conditions.</em> It
corresponds most closely to the encystment of certain protozoa&mdash;the
ameba for example. Possibly the spore represents
a very rudimentary beginning of a reproductive function
such as is gradually evolved in the higher thread bacteria,
the fission yeasts, the yeasts, the molds, etc. Its
characteristics are so markedly different, however, that the
function of preservation is certainly the main one.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that spores are formed under
adverse conditions only, because bacteria showing vigorous
growth frequently form spores rapidly. Special conditions
are necessary for their formation just as they are for the
growth and other functions of bacteria (<a href="#CHAPTER_VI" class="int-ref">Chapters VI</a> and
<a href="#CHAPTER_VII" class="int-ref">VII</a>).</p>

CELL FORMS.</h3>


<p>Though there is apparently a wide variation in the shapes
of different bacterial cells, these may all be reduced to
<em>three</em> typical <i class="term">cell forms</i>. These are: first and simplest, the
round or <i class="term">spherical</i>, typified by a ball and called the <i class="term">coccus</i>
form, or <i class="term">coccus</i>, plural cocci<a id="Marker_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="marker" title="Footnote 4">4</a> (<a href="#fig-33" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;33</a>). The coccus may be
large, that is, from 1.5µ to 2µ in diameter. The term <i class="term">macrococcus</i>
is sometimes applied to these large cocci. If the
<i class="term">coccus</i> is less than 1µ in diameter, it is sometimes spoken
of as a <i class="term">micrococcus</i>; in fact, this term is very commonly
applied to any coccus. When cocci are growing together,
many of the cells do not appear as true spheres but are more
or less distorted from pressure of their neighbors or from
failure to grow to full size after recent division. Most cocci
divide into hemispheres and then each half grows to full
size. A few cocci elongate before division and then appear
oval or elliptical.</p>

<p>The second cell form is that of a <i class="term">cylinder</i> or rod typified
by a section of a lead-pencil. The name <i class="term">bacillus</i>, plural
<i class="term">bacilli</i>, is applied to this type (<a href="#fig-34" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;34</a>). The bacillus may
be short (<a href="#fig-35" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;35</a>), 1µ or less in length, or long, up to 40µ
in rare cases. Most bacilli are from 2µ to 5µ or 6µ long.
The ends of the rod are usually rounded, occasionally square
and very rarely pointed. It is evident that a very short
rod with rounded ends approaches a coccus in form and it
is not always easy to differentiate in such cases. Most
bacilli are straight, but some are slightly curved (<a href="#fig-36" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;36</a>).</p>

<p><a id="Page_53" class="pagenum" title="53"> </a>
The third cell form is the <i class="term">spiral</i>, typified by a section of a
cork-screw and named <i class="term">spirillum</i>, plural <i class="term">spirilla</i> (<a href="#fig-37" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;37</a>). A
very short spiral consisting of only a portion of a turn is
sometimes called <i class="term">vibrio</i> (<a href="#fig-38" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;38</a>). Vibrios when seen under
the microscope look like short curved rods. The distinction
between the two can be made only by examining the
organism alive and moving in a liquid. The vibrio shows a
characteristic spiral twisting motion. Very long, flexible
spirals are usually named <i class="term">spirochetes</i> (<a href="#fig-39" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;39</a>). The spirochetes
are motile but flagella have not been shown to be
present.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Besides the three typical cell forms bacteria frequently
show very great irregularities in shape. They may be
pointed, bulged, club-shaped or even slightly branched.
<a id="Page_54" class="pagenum" title="54"> </a>
These peculiar and bizarre forms practically always occur
when some of the necessary conditions for normal growth,
discussed in <a href="#CHAPTER_VI" class="int-ref">Chapters VI</a> and <a href="#CHAPTER_VII" class="int-ref">VII</a>, are not fulfilled. They
are best regarded as <i class="term">involution</i> or <i class="term">degeneration</i> forms for this
reason (<a href="#fig-40" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;40</a>). In a very few cases it is not possible to
obtain the organism without these forms (the diphtheria
group). It is probable that these cell forms are normal in
such cases, or else conditions suitable for the normal growth
have not been obtained.</p>

CELL GROUPINGS.</h3>


<p>It has been stated that bacteria reproduce by transverse
division, that is, division across the long axis. Following
repeated divisions the new cells may or may not
remain attached. In the latter case the bacteria occur as
separate isolated individuals. In the former, arrangements
characteristic of the particular organism almost invariably
result. These arrangements are best described as <i class="term">cell
groupings</i> or <i class="term">growth forms</i>.</p>

<div class="multi-img">
<div class="figcenter width-250" id="fig-41">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;42.</span>&mdash;Diplobacillus grouping.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the case of spiral forms it is obvious that there is only
one possible grouping, that is, in chains of two or more
individuals adherent end to end. A chain of two spirilla
might be called a <i class="term">diplospirillum</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">διπλός</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;double); of
three or more, a <i class="term">streptospirillum</i> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στρεπτός</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;necklace, chain)
(<a href="#fig-41" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;41</a>). These terms are rarely used, since spirilla do
not ordinarily remain attached. Likewise the bacillus can
grow only in chains of two or more, and the terms <i class="term">diplobacillus</i>
(<a href="#fig-42" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;42</a>), bacilli in groups of two, and <i class="term">streptobacillus</i>
(<a href="#fig-43" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;43</a>), bacilli in chains are frequently used. Still the
<a id="Page_56" class="pagenum" title="56"> </a>
terms <i class="term">thread</i>, <i class="term">filament</i>, or <i class="term">chain</i> are more common for <i class="term">streptobacillus</i>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Since the coccus is spherical, <i class="term">transverse</i> division may occur
in any direction, though in three planes only at right angles
to each other. Division might occur in <em>one plane only</em> as in
spirilla and bacilli, or in <em>two planes only</em> or in <em>all three planes</em>.
As a matter of fact these three methods of division are
found among the cocci, but only one method for each particular
kind of coccus. As a result there may be a variety
of cell groupings among the cocci. When division occurs in
one plane only, the possible groupings are the same as among
the spirilla or bacilli. The cocci may occur in groups of two&mdash;<i class="term">diplococcus</i>
grouping (<a href="#fig-44" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;44</a>), or in chains&mdash;<i class="term">streptococcus</i>
grouping (<a href="#fig-45" class="int-ref">Figs.&nbsp;45</a> and <a href="#fig-46" class="int-ref">46</a>). When the grouping is in <i class="term">diplococci</i>,
<a id="Page_57" class="pagenum" title="57"> </a>
the individual cocci most commonly appear as hemispheres
with the plane surfaces apposed (<a href="#fig-44" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;44</a>). Sometimes
they appear as spheres and occasionally are even
somewhat elongated. The individuals in a streptococcus
grouping are most commonly elongated, either in the same
direction as the length of the chain, or at right angles to it.
The latter appearance is probably due to failure to enlarge
completely after division. Streptococci frequently appear
as chains of diplococci, that is, the pair resulting from the
division of a single coccus remain a little closer to each
other than to neighboring cells, as a close inspection of <a href="#fig-45" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;45</a>
will show.</p>

<p>If division occurs in <em>two planes only</em>, there may result the
above groupings and several others in addition. The four
cocci which result from a single division may remain together,
giving the <i class="term">tetracoccus</i> or <i class="term">tetrad</i> grouping. Very
rarely all the cocci divide evenly and the result is a regular
<em>rectangular flat mass</em> of cells, the total number of which is a
multiple of four. The term merismopedia (from a genus
of algæ<!--TN: was 'algae'--> which grows the same way) is applied to such a
grouping. If the cells within a group after a few divisions
do not reproduce so rapidly (lack of food), as usually happens,
the number of cells becomes uneven or at least not necessarily
a multiple of four and the resultant <em>flat mass</em> has an
<em>irregular</em>, <em>uneven outline</em>. This grouping is termed <i class="term">staphylococcus</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σταφυλος</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;a bunch of grapes) (<a href="#fig-47" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;47</a>). It is the
most common grouping among the cocci.</p>

<p>When division occurs in all three planes, there is in addition
to all the groupings possible to one- and two-plane division
a third grouping in which the cells are in <em>solid packets</em>,
<em>multiples of eight</em>. The name <i class="term">sarcina</i> is applied to this
growth form (<a href="#fig-48" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;48</a>). The individual cells in a sarcina
packet never show the typical coccus form so long as they
remain together, but are always flattened on two or more
sides.</p>

<p>The above descriptions indicate how the method of division
may be determined. If in examining a preparation the
<i class="term">sarcina</i> grouping appears, that shows <em>three-plane division</em>.
If there are no sarcina, but <i class="term">tetrads</i> or <i class="term">staphylococci</i> (rarely
<a id="Page_58" class="pagenum" title="58"> </a>
merismopedia), then the division is in <em>two planes</em>. If none
of the foregoing is observed but only <i class="term">diplo-</i> or <i class="term">streptococci</i>,
these indicate <em>one-plane division</em> only. Cocci show their
<em>characteristic</em> groupings only when grown in a liquid medium,
and such should always be used before deciding on the plane
of division.</p>

generally used as nouns. Thus the terms a diplococcus, a

of the cell form and cell grouping indicated.</p>

CLASSIFICATION.</h3>


<p>The arrangement of living organisms in groups according
to their resemblances and the adoption of <em>fixed names</em>
is of the greatest advantage in their scientific study. For
animal forms and for the higher plants this classification is
gradually becoming standardized through the International
Congress of Zoölogists and of Botanists respectively. Unfortunately,
the naming of the bacteria has not as yet been
taken up by the latter body, though announced as one of
the subjects for the Congress of 1916 (postponed on account
of the war). Hence there is at present no system which
can be regarded as either fixed or official.</p>

</div>

<p>Since Müller’s first classification of “animalcules” in 1786
numerous attempts have been made to solve the problem.
Only those beginning with Ferdinand Cohn (1872&ndash;75) are
of any real value. As long as bacteria are regarded as
plants it appears that the logical method is to follow the
well-established botanical principles in any system for naming
them. Botanists depend on morphological features
almost entirely in making their distinctions. The preceding
chapters have shown that the minute plants which are
discussed have very few such features. They are, to recapitulate,
<i class="term">cell wall</i>, <i class="term">protoplasm</i>, <i class="term">vacuoles</i>, <i class="term">metachromatic
granules</i>, <i class="term">capsules</i>, <i class="term">flagella</i>, <i class="term">spores</i>, <i class="term">cell forms</i> and <i class="term">cell groupings</i>.
Most bacteria show not more than three or four of
these features, so that it<!--TN: was 'is'--> is impossible by the aid of morphology
alone to distinguish from each other the large number
of different kinds which certainly exist. In the various
systems which are conceded to be the best these characteristics
do serve to classify them down to genera, leaving
the “species” to be determined from their <em>physiological</em>
<a id="Page_60" class="pagenum" title="60"> </a>
activities. One of these systems was adopted by the
laboratory section of the American Public Health Association
and by the Society of American Bacteriologists and was
practically the standard in this country until superseded by
the Society’s own classification. It is that of the German
Bacteriologist Migula and is given below for comparison.
Since practically the entire discussion in this book is concerned

GENERAL CONDITIONS FOR GROWTH.</h3>


<h4 id="OCCURRENCE">OCCURRENCE.</h4>

<p>Bacteria are probably the most widely distributed of
living organisms. They are found practically everywhere
on the surface of the earth. Likewise in all surface waters,
in streams, lakes and the sea. They occur in the air immediately
above the surface, since they are carried up mechanically
by air currents. They cannot fly of themselves.
There is no reason to believe that any increase in numbers
occurs to an appreciable extent in the air. The upper air,
for example, on high mountains, is nearly free from them.
So also is the air over midocean, and in high latitudes. As
a rule, the greater the amount of dust in the air, the more
numerous are the bacteria. Hence they are found more
abundantly in the air in cities and towns than in the open
country. The soil is especially rich in numbers in the upper
few feet, but they diminish rapidly below and almost disappear
at depths of about six feet unless the soil is very porous
and open, when they may be carried farther down. Hence
the waters from deep wells and springs are usually devoid
of these organisms. In the sea they occur at all levels and
have been found in bottom ooze dredged from depths of
several miles. It is perhaps needless to add that they are
found on the bodies and in the alimentary tract of human
<a id="Page_72" class="pagenum" title="72"> </a>
beings and animals; on clothing, utensils; in dwellings,
stables, outhouses, etc. From one-fourth to one-half of the
dry weight of the feces of animals and men is due to the
bacteria present. The urine is practically free from them
in health.</p>

<p>While bacteria are thus found nearly everywhere, it is an
entirely mistaken idea to suppose that all are injurious to
man. As a matter of fact, those which are dangerous are
relatively few and are for the most part found only in close
association with man. Most bacteria are harmless and the
vast majority are beneficial or even essential to man’s
existence on the earth. These facts must be constantly
borne in mind, and it is hoped that the pages which follow
will make them clear.</p>

<p>In order that any organism may thrive there are a number
of general environmental conditions which must be fulfilled.
These conditions vary more or less for each kind of organism.
Bacteria are no exception to this general rule. These
conditions may be conveniently considered under the general
heads of <i>moisture</i>; <i>temperature</i>; <i>light</i>; <i>oxygen supply</i>;
<i>osmotic pressure</i>; <i>action of electricity</i>; of <i>Röntgen</i> and <i>radium
rays</i>; <i>pressure</i>; <i>mechanical vibration</i>; and <i>chemical environment</i>,
including the <i>reaction of the medium</i>, <i>the effect of injurious
chemicals</i>, and especially the <i>food requirements of
bacteria</i>. For each of these conditions there is a <em>maximum</em>,
meaning the greatest amount of the given condition which
the organism can withstand, a <em>minimum</em>, or the least amount,
and an <em>optimum</em> or that amount which is most favorable for
development. Further, there might be distinguished a maximum
for <em>mere existence</em> and a lower maximum for <em>development</em>;
also a minimum for <em>mere existence</em> and a higher minimum
for <em>development</em>. These maxima, minima, and optima
for bacteria have been determined with exactness for only
a very few of the general conditions and for comparatively
few kinds.</p>
<a id="Page_73" class="pagenum" title="73"> </a>


<h4 id="MOISTURE">MOISTURE.</h4>

<p>The <em>maximum</em> moisture is absolutely pure water, and no
organism can thrive in this alone owing to the factor of too
low osmotic pressure and to the further factor of absence of
food material. There are many bacteria which thrive in
water containing only traces of mineral salts and a large
class whose natural habitat is surface water. These “water
bacteria” are of great benefit in the purification of streams.
They are as a class harmless to men and animals. Some
of the disease-producing bacteria like <i class="taxonomy">Bacterium typhosum</i>
(of typhoid fever) and <i class="taxonomy">Vibrio choleræ</i> (of Asiatic cholera)
were undoubtedly originally water bacteria, and it is rather
striking that in these diseases conditions are induced in
the intestine (diarrheas) which simulate the original watery
environment. The <em>minimum</em> moisture condition is absolute
dryness, and no organism can even exist, not to say
develop, in such a condition since water is an essential constituent
of living matter. Some bacteria and especially
most spores may live when dried in the air or by artificial
means for months and even years, while some are destroyed
in a few hours or days when dried (typhoid, cholera, etc.).
The optimum amount of moisture has not been determined
with any great accuracy and certainly a rather wide range
in percentage of water is permissible<!--TN: was 'permissable'--> with many, though
a liquid medium is usually most favorable for artificial
growth. The “water bacteria” have been mentioned. In
the soil a water content of 5 to 15 per cent. seems to be
most suitable for many of the organisms which aid in plant
growth. In animals and man the organisms infecting the
intestinal tract prefer a high percentage of moisture as a
rule, especially those causing disease here. Those found on
the surface of the body (pus cocci) need a less amount of
water, while those invading the tissues (tuberculosis, black-leg,
etc.) seem to be intermediate in this respect. In artificial
culture media a water content of less than 30 per cent.
inhibits the growth of most bacteria.</p>

<p>As a general rule those bacteria which require the largest
percentage of water are most susceptible to its loss and are
<a id="Page_74" class="pagenum" title="74"> </a>
most readily killed by drying. The typhoid and cholera
organisms die in a few hours when dried, while pus cocci
and tubercle bacilli live much longer.</p>


<h4 id="TEMPERATURE">TEMPERATURE.</h4>

<p>The temperature conditions for bacterial existence and
growth have been determined more accurately than any of
the other general conditions. The maximum for existence
must be placed at or near 100° since it is known that all
bacteria including spores may be killed by boiling in time.
Nevertheless, certain forms have been reported as thriving
in hot springs where the water temperature was 93°. This
is the highest known temperature for development. The
minimum for existence lies at or near the absolute zero
(-273°) since certain organisms have been subjected to the
temperature produced by the sudden evaporation of liquid
hydrogen (-256° to -265°) and have remained alive.
Whether they could withstand such temperatures indefinitely
is not known. The minimum for development is near the
freezing-point of water, since reproduction by division has
been observed in the water from melting sea-ice at a temperature
of -1.5°. Thus bacteria as a class have a range
for existence of about 373° (-273° to +100°) and for development
of 94.5° (-1.5° to +93°) certainly much wider
ranges than any other group of organisms.<a id="Marker_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="marker" title="Footnote 5">5</a></p>

<p>The optimum temperature for development varies within
rather wide limits for different organisms. In general it
may be stated that the optimum temperature is approximately
that of the natural habitat of the organism, though
there are exceptions. The optimum of the “hot spring”
bacteria just mentioned is apparently that of the springs
(93° in this case). Many soil organisms are known whose
optimum is near 70° (a temperature rarely, if ever, attained
in the soil), <em>but only when grown in air or oxygen</em>; but is
very much lower when grown in the <em>absence of oxygen</em>.
<a id="Page_75" class="pagenum" title="75"> </a>
Many other soil organisms exhibit very little difference in
rate or amount of growth when grown at temperatures
which may vary as much as 10° or 15°, apparently an
adaptation to their normal environment. The disease-producing
organisms show much narrower limits for growth,
especially those which are difficult to cultivate outside the
body. For example, the bacterium of tuberculosis in man
scarcely develops beyond the limits of 2° or 3° from the
normal body temperature of man (37°), while the bacterium
of tuberculosis in birds grows best at 41° to 45°, the normal
for birds, and the bacterium of so-called tuberculosis of cold-blooded
animals at 14° to 18°.</p>

<p>Those bacteria whose optimum temperature is above 40°
are sometimes spoken of as the “<i class="term">thermophil</i>” bacteria. The
fixing of the “thermal death-point” that is, the minimum
temperature at which the bacteria are killed is a matter of
great practical importance in many ways and numerous
determinations of this have been made with a great many
organisms and by different observers. The factors which
enter into such determinations are so many and so varied
that unless all the conditions of the experiment are given
together with the time of application, the mere statements
are worthless. It may be stated that all <em>young, actively
growing</em> (non-spore-containing) <em>disease-producing bacteria,
when exposed in watery liquids and in small quantities are
killed at a temperature of 60° within half an hour</em>. It is evident,
that this fact has very little practical application,
since the conditions stated are rarely, if ever, fulfilled except
in laboratory experiments. (See Sterilization and Pasteurization,
<a href="#CHAPTER_XIII" class="int-ref">Chapter XIII.</a>)</p>


<h4 id="LIGHT">LIGHT.</h4>

<p>Speaking generally, it can be said that light is destructive
to bacteria. Many growing forms are killed in a few hours
when properly exposed to direct sunlight and die out in
several days in the diffuse daylight of a well-lighted room.
Even spores are destroyed in a similar manner, though the
exposure must be considerably longer. Certain bacteria
<a id="Page_76" class="pagenum" title="76"> </a>
which produce colors may grow in the light, since the pigments
protect them. Some few kinds, like the sulphur bacteria,
which contain a purplish-red pigment that serves
them to break up H<sub>2</sub>S, need light for their growth. Since
disease-producing bacteria are all injuriously affected by
light, the advantage of well-lighted habitations both for
men and animals is obvious.</p>


<h4 id="OXYGEN_SUPPLY">OXYGEN SUPPLY.</h4>

<p>Oxygen is one of the constituents of protoplasm and is
therefore necessary for all organisms. This does not mean
that all organisms must obtain their supply from <em>free oxygen</em>,
however, as animals and plants generally do. This fact
is well illustrated by the differences among bacteria in this
respect. Some bacteria <em>require free oxygen</em> for their growth
and are therefore called <i class="term">aërobic</i> bacteria or <i class="term">aërobes</i> (sometimes
<i class="term">strict aërobes</i>, though the adjective is unnecessary). Others
<em>cannot grow in the presence of free oxygen</em> and are therefore
named <i class="term">anaërobic bacteria</i> or <i class="term">anaërobes</i> (strict is unnecessary).
There are still other kinds which may grow either in the
presence of free oxygen or in its absence, hence the term
<i class="term">facultative anaërobes</i> (usually) is applied to them. The distinction
between <i class="term">facultative aërobe</i> and <i class="term">facultative anaërobe</i>
might be made. The former means those which grow best
in the absence of free oxygen, though capable of growing in
its presence, while the latter term means those which grow
best in the presence of free oxygen, but are capable of growing
in its absence. The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere
in which an organism grows may be conveniently
expressed in terms of the oxygen pressure, <i>i.e.</i>, in millimeters
of mercury. It is evident that the maximum, minimum
and optimum oxygen pressures for anaërobic bacteria
are the same, namely, 0&nbsp;mm.&nbsp;Hg. This is true only for natural
conditions, since a number of anaërobic organisms have
been gradually accustomed to increasing amounts of O, so
that by this process of training they finally grew in ordinary
air, that is, at an oxygen pressure of about 150&nbsp;mm. Hg.
(Normal air pressure is 760&nbsp;mm.&nbsp;Hg. and oxygen makes up
<a id="Page_77" class="pagenum" title="77"> </a>
one-fifth of the air.) The minimum O pressure for facultative
anaërobes is also 0&nbsp;mm.&nbsp;Hg. Some experiments have
been made to determine the limits for aërobes, but on a few
organisms only, so that no general conclusions can be drawn
from them. To illustrate: <i class="taxonomy">Bacillus subtilis</i> (a common

<p class="continued">These few instances do not disclose any general principles
which may be applied either for the growth or for the distinction
of aërobes or facultative anaërobes.</p>

<p>It has been shown that compressed oxygen will kill some
bacteria but this method of destroying them has little or
no practical value. Oxygen in the form of ozone, O<sub>3</sub>, is
rapidly destructive to bacteria, and this fact is applied practically
in the purification of water supplies for certain cities
where the ozone is generated by electricity obtained cheaply
from water power. The same is true of oxygen in the
“nascent state” as illustrated by the use of hypochlorites
for the same purpose.</p>

<p>It was stated (<a href="#Page_74" class="int-ref">p.&nbsp;74</a>) that certain thermophil bacteria in
the soil have an optimum temperature for growth <em>in the air</em>
which is much higher than is ever reached in their natural
habitat and that they grow at a moderate temperature under
<i class="term">anaërobic</i> conditions. It has been shown that if these organisms
are grown with aërobes or facultative anaërobes they
thrive at ordinary room temperature. These latter organisms
<a id="Page_78" class="pagenum" title="78"> </a>
by using up the oxygen apparently keep the tension
low, and this explains how such organisms grow in the soil.<a id="Marker_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="marker" title="Footnote 6">6</a></p>


<h4 id="OSMOTIC_PRESSURE">OSMOTIC PRESSURE.</h4>

<p>Like all living cells bacteria are very susceptible to changes
in the density of the surrounding medium. If placed in a
medium less concentrated than their own protoplasm water
is absorbed and they “swell up”; while if placed in a denser
medium, water is given off and they shrink (plasmoptysis
or plasmolysis). Should these differences be marked or
the transition be sudden, the cell walls may even burst and
the organisms be destroyed. If the differences are not
too great or if the transition is made gradually, the organisms
may not be destroyed, but will either cease to grow and
slowly die out, or will show very much retarded growth, or
will produce abnormal cell forms. This is illustrated in the
laboratory in attempting to grow bacteria on food material
which has dried out. A practical application of osmotic
effects is in the use of a high percentage of sugar in preserving
fruits, etc., and in the salting of meats. Neither the
cane-sugar nor the common salt themselves injure the bacteria
chemically, but by the high concentration prevent their
development. In drying material in order to preserve it
there are two factors involved: first, the loss of water necessary
for growth and second, the increased osmotic pressure.</p>

<p>In a medium of greater density diffusion of water is
outward from the cell and this will continue until an equilibrium
is established between cell contents and medium.
Food for the organism <em>must be in solution and enter the cell
by diffusion</em>. Therefore, growth ceases in a medium too
dense, since water to carry food in solution does not enter
the cell.</p>
<a id="Page_79" class="pagenum" title="79"> </a>


<h4 id="ELECTRICITY">ELECTRICITY.</h4>

<p>Careful experimenters have shown that the electric current,
either direct or alternating, has no direct destructive
effect on bacteria. In a liquid medium the organisms may
be attracted to or repelled from one or the other pole or
may arrange themselves in definite ways between the poles
(galvanotaxis), but are not injured. However, electricity
through the <em>secondary</em> effects produced, may be used to
destroy bacteria. If the passage of the electric current
<em>increases the temperature</em> of the medium sufficiently, the bacteria
will be killed, or if <em>injurious chemical substances</em> are
formed (ozone, chlorine, acids, bases, etc.), the same result
will follow (see Ozone, <a href="#Page_77" class="int-ref">pp.&nbsp;77</a> and <a href="#Page_157" class="int-ref">157</a>).</p>


<h4 id="RADIATIONS">RADIATIONS.</h4>

<p>Röntgen or <i>x</i>-rays and radium emanations when properly
applied to bacteria will destroy them. The practical
use of these agents for the direct destruction of bacteria in
diseases of man or animals is restricted to those cases where
they may be applied directly to the diseased area, since they
are just as injurious to the animal cell as they are to the
bacteria, and even more so. Their skilful use as <em>stimuli to
the body cells</em> to enable them to resist and overcome bacteria
and other injurious organisms or cell growths is an entirely
different function and will not be considered here.</p>


<h4 id="PRESSURE">PRESSURE.</h4>

<p>Hydrostatic pressure up to about 10,000 pounds per
square inch is without appreciable effect on bacteria as has
been shown by several experimenters and also by finding
living bacteria in the ooze dredged from the bottom of the
ocean at depths of several miles.</p>

<p>Pressures from 10,000 to 100,000 pounds show variable
effects. Some bacteria are readily killed and others, even
non-spore formers, are only slightly affected. The time
factor is important in this connection. The presence of
acids, even CO<sub>2</sub>, or organic acids, results in the destruction
of most non-spore formers.</p>
<a id="Page_80" class="pagenum" title="80"> </a>


<h4 id="MECHANICAL_VIBRATION">MECHANICAL VIBRATION.</h4>

<p>Vibrations transmitted to bacteria in a liquid may be
injurious to them under certain circumstances. Some of
the larger forms like <i class="taxonomy">Bacillus subtilis</i> may be completely
destroyed by shaking in a rapidly moving shaking machine
in a few hours. Bacteria in liquids placed on portions of
machinery where only a slight trembling is felt, have been
found to be killed after several days. Reinke has shown
that the passing of strong sound waves through bacterial
growths markedly inhibits their development.</p>

CHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT.</h3>


<h4 id="REACTION_OF_MEDIUM">REACTION OF MEDIUM.</h4>

<p>Most bacteria are very susceptible to changes in the
degree of acidity or alkalinity of the medium in which they
grow. Some kinds prefer a slightly acid reaction, some a
slightly alkaline, and some a neutral (with reference to
litmus as indicator). The organism which is the commonest
cause of the souring of milk thrives so well in the acid
medium it produces that it crowds out practically all other
kinds, though its own growth is eventually stopped by too
much acid. Acid soils are usually low in numbers of bacteria
and as a consequence produce poor crops. The disease-producing
bacteria as a class grow best in a medium which
is slightly alkaline.</p>

<p>Accurate determination of limits have been made on but
few organisms. The reaction is a most important factor in
growing bacteria on artificial media (see Making of Media,
<a href="#CHAPTER_XVI" class="int-ref">Chapter XVI</a>).</p>

<h4 id="CHEMICAL_COMPOSITION">CHEMICAL COMPOSITION.</h4>

<p>The chemical composition is subject to wide variation
chiefly for two reasons: First, the cell wall in most instances
seems to exert only a slight selective action in the absorption
of mineral salts so that their concentration within the cell
is very nearly that of the surrounding medium. Second,
the chief organic constitutents vary remarkably with the
kind and amount of food material available&mdash;a rich protein
<a id="Page_82" class="pagenum" title="82"> </a>
pabulum increases the protein, a plentiful supply of carbohydrates
or of fat results in the storing of more fat, especially
and <i>vice versa</i>. These facts must be borne in mind in considering
the chemistry of bacteria.</p>

<p>Of the chemical elements known, only the following
seem to be essential in the structure of bacteria: carbon,
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, chlorine,
potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, manganese. Other
elements, as sodium, iodine, silicon, aluminum, lithium,
copper, etc., have been reported by different analysts, but
none of them can be regarded as essential, except possibly
in isolated instances.</p>

<p>These elements exist in the bacterial cell in a great variety
of combinations of which the most abundant is <em>water</em>. The
amount of water varies in different species from 75 to 90
per cent. of the total weight in growing cells, and is less in
spores. The amount of <em>ash</em> has been shown by different
observers to vary from less than 2 per cent. to as much as
30 per cent. of the <em>dry weight</em>. The following table compiled
from various sources will give an idea of the relative
abundance of the different elements in the ash.</p>

<p>As to the form in which the last six elements in the table
exist in the cell, little is known. The sulphur and phosphorus
are essential constituents of various proteins. The
high percentage of phosphorus points to nuclein compounds
as its probable source.</p>

<p>The carbon and nitrogen, together with most of the
hydrogen and oxygen not united as water, make up the
great variety of organic compounds which compose the main
substances in the bacterial cell.</p>

<p>It has already been stated that the essential structures in
the bacterial cell are cell wall and protoplasm, including
<a id="Page_83" class="pagenum" title="83"> </a>
the nuclein. These differ markedly in chemical composition.
It is well known that the cell walls of green plants
consist largely of cellulose and closely related substances.<a id="Marker_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="marker" title="Footnote 7">7</a>
<i class="term">True cellulose</i> has been recognized in but very few bacteria.
(<i class="taxonomy">Sarcina ventriculi</i>, Migula; <i class="taxonomy">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, Hammerschlag,
Dreyfuss, Nishimura; <i class="taxonomy">Bacillus subtilis</i>, Dreyfuss;
<i class="taxonomy">Acetobacter xylinum</i>, Brown; <i class="taxonomy">Acetobacter acidi oxalici</i>,
Banning; and a few others.) It is certainly not an important
constituent of the cell wall in many. On the other hand,
<i class="term">hemicellulose</i> and <i>gum-like</i> substances have been identified
in numerous organisms of this class as important constituents
of the cell wall and of the capsule which is probably
an outgrowth from the latter. Practically always associated
with these substances are compounds containing nitrogen.
One of these has been certainly identified as <i class="term">chitin</i> or
a closely similar substance. Chitin is the nitrogenous substance
which enters largely into the composition of the hard
parts of insects, spiders and crustaceans. It is an interesting
fact to find this substance characteristic of these animals in
bacteria, as well as other fungi.</p>

<p>Though it is extremely difficult to separate the cell wall
of bacteria from the cell contents, in the light of our present
knowledge it can be stated that the cell walls are composed
of a carbohydrate body closely related to cellulose, though
not true cellulose, probably in close combination with chitin.</p>

<p>Of the organic constituents of the cell contents the most
abundant are various proteins which ordinarily make up
about one-half of the dry weight of the entire cell. The
“Mycoproteid” of Nencki, 1879, and other earlier workers
is deserving of little more than historical interest, since these
substances were certainly very impure and probably consisted
of mixtures of several “proteins” in the more recent
sense.</p>

<p><a id="Page_84" class="pagenum" title="84"> </a>
From later studies it seems probable that substances
resembling the albumin of higher forms do not occur in
bacteria, at least in appreciable quantities. Globulin has
been reported by Hellmich in an undetermined bacterium,
but is certainly not commonly found. The larger portion
of the protein is of a comparatively simple type, in fact,
consists of protamins most of which are in combination
with nucleic acid as nucleoprotamins. Practically all recent
workers find a high percentage of nuclein, both actually
isolated and as indicated by the amounts of purin bases&mdash;xanthin,
guanin, adenin&mdash;obtained, as well as by the abundance
of phosphorus in the ash, already mentioned. Some
of these nucleins have been shown to have poisonous properties.</p>

<p>Closely related to but not identical with the proteins are
the enzymes and toxins which are formed in the cell and
exist there as endo-enzymes or endo-toxins respectively.
These substances will be discussed later under the heading
“Physiological Activities of Bacteria” (<a href="#CHAPTER_XII" class="int-ref">Chapter XII</a>).</p>

<p>Carbohydrates are not commonly present in the cell contents,
though glycogen has been observed in a few and a
substance staining blue with iodine in one or two others.
This latter substance was at first considered to be starch
“granulose,” but is probably more closely related to glycogen.</p>

<p>Fats seem to be very generally present. The commoner
fats&mdash;tri-olein, tri-palmitin, tri-stearin have been found by
many analysts. The “acid-fast bacteria” are particularly
rich in fatty substances, especially the higher wax-like fats.
Lecithins (phosphorized fats) and cholesterins (not fats but
alcohols) have been repeatedly observed and probably occur
in all bacteria as products of katabolism.</p>

<p>Organic acids and esters occur as cell constituents but
will be discussed in connection with their more characteristic
occurrences as products of bacterial activity, as will
also pigments which may likewise be intracellular in some
instances.</p>

<p>The following analysis of tubercle bacilli, from de
Schweinitz and Dorset, while not intended as typical for
<a id="Page_85" class="pagenum" title="85"> </a>
all bacteria, still illustrates the high percentage of protein
compounds which undoubtedly occurs in most, as well as
showing the large amount of fatty substance in a typical
“acid-fast” organism:</p>

<h4 id="GENERAL_FOOD_RELATIONSHIPS_METABOLISM">GENERAL FOOD RELATIONSHIPS. METABOLISM.</h4>

<p>The foregoing brief review of the chemical composition
of the bacterial cell illustrates the variety of compounds
which necessarily occurs, but affords no definite clue as to
the source of the elements which enter into these compounds.
These elements come from the material which the organism
uses as food. Under this term are included elements or
compounds which serve as building material, either for new
cell substance or to repair waste, or as sources of energy.</p>

<p>An organism which is capable of making use of an element
in the free state is said to be <i class="term">prototrophic</i> for that particular
element. Thus aërobes and facultative anaërobes are prototrophic
for O. The “root-tubercle bacteria” of leguminous
and other plants and certain free living soil organisms are
prototrophic for N.<a id="Marker_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="marker" title="Footnote 8">8</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, if the element must be secured from
compounds, then the organism is <i class="term">metatrophic</i> in respect to
the element in question. Should the compound be inorganic,
the term <i class="term">autotrophic</i> is applied to the organism and
<i class="term">heterotrophic</i> if the compound is organic. It is very probable
that anaërobes, exclusive of a few nitrogen absorbers, are
metatrophic for all the elements they utilize. With the
exception of the anaërobes it seems that all bacteria are <i class="term">mixotrophic</i>,
that is, prototrophic for one or two elements and
auto- or heterotrophic for the others.<a id="Marker_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="marker" title="Footnote 9">9</a></p>

<p><a id="Page_87" class="pagenum" title="87"> </a>
Those bacteria whose food consists of dead material are
spoken of as <i class="term">saprophytes</i>, while those whose natural habitat,
without reference to their food, is in or on other living
organisms are called <i class="term">parasites</i>. The <i class="term">host</i> is the organism in
or on which the parasite lives. Parasites may be of several
kinds. Those which neither do injury nor are of benefit to
the host are called <i class="term">non-pathogenic</i> parasites or <i class="term">commensals</i>;
many of the bacteria in the intestines of man and other animals
are of this class. Those which do injury to the host
are called <i class="term">pathogenic</i> or disease-producing, as the organisms
causing the transmissible diseases of animals and plants.<a id="Marker_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="marker" title="Footnote 10">10</a>
Finally, we have those parasites which are of benefit to and
receive benefit from the host. These are called <i class="term">symbionts</i>
or <i class="term">symbiotic parasites</i> and the mutual relationship <i class="term">symbiosis</i>.
Certain of the intestinal bacteria in man and especially in
herbivorous animals are undoubted <i class="term">symbionts</i>, as are also
the “root-tubercle bacteria” already mentioned.</p>

<p>It is evident that all parasites that may be cultivated
outside the body are for the time <i class="term">saprophytic</i>, hence the terms
<i class="term">strict</i> parasites and <i class="term">facultative</i> parasites, which should require
no further explanation.</p>

<p>The changes which the above-mentioned types of food
material undergo in the various anabolic and katabolic processes
<em>within the cell</em> are as yet but very slightly known.
Nevertheless there are a number of reactions brought about
by bacteria acting on various food materials, partly within
<em>but largely without the cell</em> which are usually described as
“physiological activities” or “biochemical reactions.” Some
of these changes are to be ascribed to the utilization of
certain of the elements and compounds in these materials
as tissue builders, some as energy-yielding reactions and still
others as giving rise to substances that are of direct benefit
to the organism concerned in its competition with other
organisms.</p>

<p>Though all of the twelve elements already mentioned are
essential for the growth of every bacterium, two of them
<a id="Page_88" class="pagenum" title="88"> </a>
are of especial importance for the reason that most of the
“physiological activities” to be described in the next chapters
are centered around their acquisition and utilization.
These elements are <i>carbon</i> and <i>nitrogen</i>. Some few of the
special activities of certain groups have to do with one or
the other of the remaining nine, as will be shown later.
But generally speaking <em>when a bacterium under natural conditions
secures an adequate supply of carbon and nitrogen, the
other elements are readily available in sufficient amount</em>.</p>

<p>Carbon is necessary not only because it is an essential
constituent of protoplasm but because its oxidation is the
chief source of the energy necessary for the internal life of
the cell, though nitrogen and sulphur replace it in this
function with a few forms. This latter use of carbon constitutes
what may be called its <i class="term">respiratory function</i>. Bacteria
like other organisms in their respiration utilize oxygen
and give off carbon dioxide. The amount of the latter given
off from the cell in this way is very small as compared with
that which is frequently produced as an accompaniment of
other reactions (see <a href="#FERMENTATION_OF_CARBOHYDRATES" class="int-ref">Fermentation</a>, next chapter). But
there is no doubt of its formation and it has been determined
by a few investigators. On account of this use of carbon,
bacteria require relatively large amounts of this element.
One group of bacteria concerned in the spontaneous heating
of coal seems to be able to use free carbon from this material.
Another group is said to be able to oxidize marsh gas, CH<sub>4</sub>,
and use this as its source of carbon. The nitrite, nitrate
and sulphur bacteria mentioned later utilize carbon dioxide
and carbonates as their carbon supply, and one kind has
been described which uses carbon monoxide. With these
few exceptions bacteria are dependent on <i>organic compounds</i>
for their carbon and cannot use CO<sub>2</sub> as green plants do.</p>

<p>The oxygen requirement is high partly for the same
reason that carbon is, <i>i.e.</i>, respiration. Oxygen is one of
the constituents of protoplasm, and combined with hydrogen
forms water which makes up such a large part of the
living cell. Anaërobic bacteria are dependent on so-called
“molecular respiration” for their energy. That is, through
a shifting or rearrangement of the atoms in the compounds
<a id="Page_89" class="pagenum" title="89"> </a>
used as food the oxidation of carbon is brought about.
Enzymes are probably responsible for this action. Carbon
dioxide is produced by anaërobes as well as by aërobes,
and frequently in amounts readily collected. A carbohydrate
is usually though not always essential for the growth
of anaërobes and serves them as the best source of energy.</p>

<p>Nitrogen is the characteristic element of living material.
Protoplasm is a chemical substance in unstable equilibrium
and nitrogen is responsible for this instability. No other
of the commoner elements is brought into combination with
such difficulty, nor is so readily liberated when combined
(all commercial explosives are nitrogen compounds). Bacteria,
like other forms of protoplasm, require nitrogen. More
marked peculiarities are shown by bacteria with reference
to the sources from which they derive their nitrogen than
for carbon. Some can even combine the free nitrogen of the
air and furnish the only natural means of any importance
for this reaction. Some few forms (the nitrite and nitrate
formers, <a href="#CHAPTER_XI" class="int-ref">Chapter XI</a>) obtain their energy from the oxidation
of inorganic nitrogen compounds, ammonia and nitrites
respectively, and not from carbon. These latter bacteria
use carbon from carbon dioxide and carbonates. A great
many bacteria can secure their nitrogen from nitrates but
some are restricted to organic nitrogen. Many bacteria
obtain their carbon from the same organic compounds from
which their nitrogen is derived.</p>

<p>Sulphur serves mainly as a constituent of protein compounds
in the protoplasmic structure. In some of the <i>sulphur</i>
bacteria it is a source of energy, since either free sulphur
or H<sub>2</sub>S is oxidized by them. Some of these bacteria
can obtain their carbon from CO<sub>2</sub> or carbonates, and their
nitrogen from nitrates or ammonium salts.</p>

<p>Whether the <i>iron</i> bacteria, belonging to the genus <i class="taxonomy">Crenothrix</i>
of the higher, thread bacteria, use this element or its
compounds as sources of energy is still a disputed question.
The evidence is largely in favor of this view.</p>

<p>Free hydrogen has been shown to be oxidized by some
forms which obtain their energy in this way.</p>

<p>Whether there is a special class of <i>phosphorus</i> bacteria
remains to be discovered. That phosphorus is oxidized during
<a id="Page_90" class="pagenum" title="90"> </a>
the activity of many bacteria is undoubted, but whether
this represents a source of energy or is the accidental by-product
of other activities is undetermined.</p>

<p>Practically nothing is known about the metabolism of the
other elements as such.</p>

<p>From the preceding brief review of the relation of certain
bacteria to some of the elements in the free state and from
the further fact that there is scarcely a known natural
organic compound which cannot be utilized by some kind
of bacterium, it is evident that this class of organisms has
a far wider range of adaptability than any other class, and
this adaptability helps to explain their seemingly universal
distribution.</p>

<p>As to the metabolism <em>within the cell</em>, no more is known than
is the case with other cells, nor even as much. The materials
used for growth and as sources of energy are taken into
the cell, built up into various compounds some of which
have been enumerated and in part broken down again.
Carbon dioxide and water are formed in the latter process.
What other katabolic products occur it is not easy to determine.
Certainly some of the substances mentioned in the
next chapters are such products but it is not always possible
to separate those formed <em>inside</em> the cell from those formed
<em>outside</em>. Perhaps most of the latter should be considered
true metabolic products. It would seem that on account
of the simplicity of structure of the bacterial cell and of the
compounds which they may use as food they would serve
as excellent objects for the study of the fundamental problems
of cell metabolism. Their minuteness and the nearly
impossible task of separating them completely from the
medium in or on which they are grown makes the solution
of these problems one of great difficulty.</p>

<p>When all of the environmental conditions necessary for
the best development of a given bacterium are fulfilled, it
will then develop to the limit of its capacity. This development
is characterized essentially by its reproduction, which
occurs by transverse division. The rate of this division
varies much with the kind even under good conditions.
The most rapid rate so far observed is a division in eighteen
<a id="Page_91" class="pagenum" title="91"> </a>
minutes. A great many reproduce every half-hour and this
may be taken as a good average rate. If such division
could proceed without interruption, a little calculation will
show that in about sixty-five hours a mass as large as the
earth would be produced.</p>

</table>

<p>Such a rate of increase evidently cannot be kept up long
on account of many limiting factors, chief of which is the
food supply.</p>

<p>The foregoing calculation is based on the assumption that
the organism divides in one plane only. If it divides in 2 or
3 planes, the rate is much faster, as is shown by the following
formulæ, which indicate the theoretical rate of division:</p>

<div class="calculation"><!--TN: repeated text indicated by dittos in original text-->
  S = number of bacteria after a given number of divisions.<br />
  a = number at the beginning, and n = number of divisions.<br />
  1 plane division S = 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>a<br />
  2 plane division S = 2<sup>2<i>n</i></sup>a<br />
  3 plane division S = 2<sup>3<i>n</i></sup>a
</div>

<p>With two-plane or three-plane division, assuming that
each organism attains full size, as was assumed in the first
calculation, the “mass as large as the earth” would be
attained in about thirty-two and twenty-two hours respectively.</p>

<p>This extraordinary rate of increase explains in large
measure why bacteria are able to bring about such great
chemical changes in so short a time as is seen in the rapid
“spoiling” of food materials, especially liquids. The reactions
brought about by bacteria on substances which are
soluble and diffusible are essentially “surface reactions.”
The material diffuses into the cell over its entire surface
with little hindrance. The bacteria are usually distributed
throughout the medium, so that there is very intimate contact
<a id="Page_92" class="pagenum" title="92"> </a>
in all parts of the mass which favors rapid chemical
action. The following calculation illustrates this:</p>

<div class="calculation">
The volume of a coccus 1µ in diameter is <span class="no-wrap">0.5236 × 10<sup>-13</sup> cc</span>.<br />

The surface of a coccus 1µ in diameter is <span class="no-wrap">π × 10<sup>-8</sup> sq. cm</span>.
</div>

<p>It is not uncommon to find in milk on the point of souring
1,000,000,000 bacteria per cc.</p>

<p>Assuming these to be cocci of 1µ diameter the volume of
these bacteria in a liter is only 0.05&nbsp;cc. or in the liter there
would be 19999 parts of milk and only 1 part bacteria. The
surface area of these bacteria is 3141.6&nbsp;sq.&nbsp;cm. With this
large surface exposed, it is not strange that the change from
“on the point of souring” to “sour” occurs within an hour
or less.</p>

<p>Although large numbers of bacteria can and do cause
great chemical changes the amount of material actually
utilized for maintenance of the cell is very slight, infinitesimal
almost, and yet is fairly comparable to that required
for man, as is illustrated by the following computations:</p>

<p>E. Kohn has shown that certain water bacteria grew well
in water to which there was added per liter 0.000002&nbsp;mg.
dextrose, 0.00000007&nbsp;mg. (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and 0.0000000007&nbsp;mg.
(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>. The bacteria numbered about 1000 per cc.
Taking the specific gravity at 1 (a little too low) the mass
of the bacteria in the liter was about 0.001&nbsp;mg. Hence the
bacteria used 0.002 of their weight of carbohydrate and
0.00007 of ammonium sulphate. A 150-pound (75-kilo) man
can live on 375 g. of sugar (0.005 of his weight) and 52.5 g. of
protein (0.0007 of his weight). From these figures it can
be calculated that the man utilizes about two and a half
times as much carbohydrate and about seven times as much
nitrogen as the bacterium, relatively speaking.</p>

PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES.</h3>


<p>The physiological activities of motion, reproduction and
metabolism within the cell have been discussed in previous
chapters. The objects in view in the discussion of the
“physiological activities” (sometimes spoken of as “biochemical”
activities) of bacteria in this and subsequent
chapters are to familiarize the student to some extent with
the great range of chemical changes brought about by these
minute organisms, to show their usefulness, even their
necessity, and to impress the fact that it is chiefly by a careful
study of these “activities” that individual kinds of
bacteria are identified. It should always be borne in mind
that the bacteria, in bringing about these changes which are
so characteristic in many instances, are simply engaged in
their own life struggle, in securing the elements which they
need for growth, in liberating energy for vital processes, or
occasionally in providing conditions which favor their own
development and hinder that of their competitors.</p>


<h4 id="FERMENTATION_OF_CARBOHYDRATES">FERMENTATION OF CARBOHYDRATES.</h4>

<p>By this is meant the changes which different carbohydrates
undergo when subjected to bacterial action.<a id="Marker_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="marker" title="Footnote 11">11</a></p>

<p>These changes are marked chiefly by the production of
gas or acid. The former is called “gaseous fermentation”
the latter “acid fermentation.” The gases commonly produced
<a id="Page_94" class="pagenum" title="94"> </a>
are carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) hydrogen and marsh gas
(CH<sub>4</sub>). Other gases of the paraffin series may also be formed
as ethane (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>), acetylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>), etc. CO<sub>2</sub> and H are the
ones usually formed from sugars by the few gas-forming
<a id="Page_95" class="pagenum" title="95"> </a>
bacteria which produce disease, though even here some CH<sub>4</sub>
is present. The common <i class="taxonomy">Bacterium coli</i> forms all three,
though the CH<sub>4</sub> is in smallest quantity.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>In the fermentation of the polysaccharids&mdash;starch and
especially cellulose and woody material&mdash;large amounts of
CH<sub>4</sub> occur, particularly when the changes are due to anaërobic
bacteria. This phenomenon may be readily observed
in sluggish streams, ponds and swamps where vegetable
matter accumulates on the bottom. The bubbles of gas
which arise when the mass is disturbed explode if a lighted
match is applied to them.</p>

<p>The author has conducted a number of experiments to
demonstrate this action as follows: Material taken from the
bottom<!--TN: was 'botton'--> of a pond in the fall after vegetation had died out
was packed into a cylinder five feet long and six inches in
diameter, water was added to within about 2 inches of the
top. After leaving them open for a few days to permit all
the dissolved oxygen to be used up by the aërobes, the cylinders
were tightly capped and allowed to stand undisturbed.
Pressure gauges reading to 500&nbsp;lbs. were attached (<a href="#fig-60" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;60</a>).
At the end of six months the gauge showed a pressure beyond
the limits of the readings on it. Most of the gas was collected
and measured 146 liters. An analysis of portions
collected when about one-half had been allowed to escape
showed the following composition, according to Prof. D.&nbsp;J.
Demorest of the Department of Metallurgy:</p>

<p>In the author’s opinion natural gas and petroleum have
been formed in this way<a id="Marker_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="marker" title="Footnote 12">12</a> (<a href="#fig-61" class="int-ref">Figs.&nbsp;61</a> and <a href="#fig-62" class="int-ref">62</a>).</p>

<p>One of the very few practical uses of the gaseous fermentation
of carbohydrates is in making “salt rising” bread.
The “rising” of the material is due not to yeasts but to the
formation of gas by certain bacteria which are present on
the corn meal or flour used in the process (<a href="#fig-63" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;63</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig-63">

</div>

<p><a id="Page_96" class="pagenum" title="96"> </a>
Another is in the formation of the “holes” or “eyes” so
characteristic of Swiss and other types of cheese (<a href="#fig-64" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;64</a>).</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;64.</span>&mdash;Ohio Swiss cheese. The “eyes” are due to gas formed by bacteria
during the ripening of the cheese.</div>
</div>

<p>A great many organic acids are formed during the “acid
fermentation” of carbohydrates by bacteria. Each kind of
bacterium, as a rule, forms several different acids as well as
other substances, though usually one is produced in much
larger amounts, and the kind of fermentation is named from
this acid. One of the commonest of these acids is lactic.
<a id="Page_97" class="pagenum" title="97"> </a>
The “lactic acid bacteria” form a very large and important
group and are indispensable in many commercial processes.
In the making of butter the cream is first “ripened,” as is
the milk from which many kinds of cheese are made (<a href="#fig-65" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;65</a>).
The chief feature of this “ripening” is the formation of lactic
acid from the milk-sugar by the action of bacteria. A
<a id="Page_98" class="pagenum" title="98"> </a>
similar change occurs in the popular “Bulgarian fermented
milk.” The reaction is usually represented by the equation:</p>

<div class="equation">
<span class="formula"><small>Milk-sugar.</small><br />
C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub></span>

=
<span class="formula"><small>Lactic acid.</small><br />
4C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub></span>
</div>

<p class="continued">It is not probable that the change occurs quantitatively as
indicated, because a number of other substances are also
formed. Some of these are acetic and succinic acids and
alcohol. Another industrial use of this acid fermentation
is in the preparation of “sauer kraut.” These bacteria are
chiefly anaërobic and grow best in a relatively high salt
concentration. They occur naturally on the cabbage leaves.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig-65">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;65.</span>&mdash;A cream ripener. In this apparatus cream is “ripened,” <i>i.e.</i>,
undergoes lactic acid fermentation, preparatory to making it into butter.</div>
</div>

<p>In the formation of ensilage (<a href="#fig-66" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;66</a>) the lactic acid bacteria
play a very important part, as they do also in “sour
mash” distilling, and in many kinds of natural “pickling.”
In fact, whenever green vegetable material “sours” spontaneously,
lactic acid bacteria are always present and
account for a large part of the acid. This property of lactic
<a id="Page_99" class="pagenum" title="99"> </a>
acid formation is also taken advantage of in the preparation
of lactic acid on a commercial scale in at least one plant in
this country.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;66.</span>&mdash;Filling a silo on the University farm.</div>
</div>

<p>Acetic acid is another common product of acid fermentation.
However, in vinegar making the acetic acid is not
formed directly from the sugar in the fruit juice by bacteria.
The sugar is first converted into alcohol by yeasts,
then the alcohol is <i class="term">oxidized</i> to acid by the bacteria (<a href="#fig-67" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;67</a>).
The reaction may be represented as follows:</p>

<div class="equation">
<span class="formula"><small>Dextrose.</small><br />

<span class="formula">H<sub>2</sub>O.</span>
</div>

<p>Butyric acid is generally produced where fermentation of
carbohydrates occurs under <i class="term">anaërobic</i> conditions. Some of
the “strong” odor of certain kinds of cheese is due to this
acid which is formed partly from the milk-sugar remaining
in the cheese. Most of it under these conditions comes from
the proteins of the cheese and especially from the fat (see
<a href="#Page_101" class="int-ref">page 101</a>).</p>

<p><a id="Page_100" class="pagenum" title="100"> </a>
As has been indicated alcohol is a common accompaniment
of most acid fermentations, as are the esters of acids
other than the chief product. Bacteria are not used in
a commercial way to produce alcohol, however, as the
yield is too small. There are some few bacteria in which
the amount of alcohol is prominent enough to call the process
an “alcoholic fermentation” rather than an acid one.
In brewing and distilling industries, <i class="term">yeasts</i> are used to make
the alcohol, though molds replace them in some countries
(“sake” and “arrak” from rice).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig-67">
<img src="images/fig-67.jpg" width="242" height="500" alt="" /><br />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;67.</span>&mdash;A vinegar ripener. The tank shown opened at the side is filled
with a special type of beech shavings which thus provide a very large surface.
The apple juice which has been previously fermented with yeast, which
converts the sugar into alcohol, is allowed to trickle through the openings
at the top over the shavings. The acetic acid bacteria on the shavings
rapidly oxidize the alcohol to acetic acid. The vinegar is drawn off below.</div>
</div>

<p>Under ordinary conditions the carbohydrate is never completely
fermented, since the accumulation of the product&mdash;acid&mdash;stops
<a id="Page_101" class="pagenum" title="101"> </a>
the reaction. If the acid is neutralized by the
addition of an alkali&mdash;calcium or magnesium carbonate is
best&mdash;then the sugar may all be split up. Where such fermentation
occurs under natural conditions, the products
are further split up, partly by molds and partly by acid-destroying
bacteria into simpler acids and eventually to
carbon dioxide and water, so that the end-products of the
complete fermentation of carbohydrate material in nature
are carbon dioxide, hydrogen, marsh gas, and water.</p>

<p>In all of these fermentations the bacteria are utilizing the
<i>carbon</i> both as building material and for oxidation and the
fermentations are incidental to this use. As a rule, the acid-forming
bacteria can withstand a higher concentration of
acid than the other bacteria that would utilize the same
material, and in a short time crowd out their competitors
or inhibit their growth, and thus have better conditions for
their own existence, though finally their growth is also
checked by the acid.</p>


<h4 id="SPLITTING_OF_FATS">SPLITTING OF FATS.</h4>

<p>The <i class="term">splitting of fats</i> into glycerin and the particular acid
or acids involved may be brought about by bacteria. An
illustration is the development of rancidity in butter at
times and the “strong” odor of animal fats on long keeping
and of many kinds of cheese&mdash;“limburger”&mdash;in this country.
Generally speaking, however, fats are not vigorously attacked,
as is illustrated by the difficulties due to accumulation
of fats in certain types of sewage-disposal works. The
chemical change is represented by the equation:</p>

PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES (<span class="smcap">Continued</span>).</h3>


<h4 id="PUTREFACTION_OF_PROTEINS">PUTREFACTION OF PROTEINS.</h4>

<p>The word “<i class="term">putrefaction</i>” is now restricted to the action of
bacteria on the <em>complex nitrogen-containing substances</em>, proteins,
and their immediate derivatives. The process is
usually accompanied by the development of foul odors.</p>

<p>Bacteria make use of proteins chiefly as a source of nitrogen,
but also as a source of carbon and other elements.
Proteins contain nitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulphur
and frequently phosphorus. Some of the metals&mdash;potassium,
sodium, calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese
and the non-metal chlorine&mdash;are nearly always associated
with them more or less intimately. Since these bodies
are the most complex of natural chemical substances it
follows that the breaking up of the molecule to secure a
part of the nitrogen gives rise to a great variety of products.</p>

<p>There are marked differences among bacteria in their
ability to attack this class of compounds. Some can break
up the most complex natural proteins such as albumins,
globulins, glyco-, chromo-, and nucleoproteins, nucleins and
albuminoid derivatives like gelatin. The term <i class="term">saprogenic</i>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σαπρος</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;rotten) is sometimes applied to bacteria which
have this power. These proteins are large-moleculed and
not diffusible<!--TN: was 'diffusable'-->, so that the first splitting up that they undergo
must occur outside the bacterial cell. The products of
this first splitting may diffuse into the cell and be utilized
there. The bacteria of this class attack not only these proteins
in the natural state or in solution, but also in the coagulated
state. The coagulum becomes softened and finally
changed into a liquid condition. The process when applied
to the casein of milk is usually called “digestion,” also when
<a id="Page_103" class="pagenum" title="103"> </a>
coagulated blood serum is acted on. In the latter case the
serum is more commonly said to be “liquefied” as is the
case when gelatin is the substance changed. Most of these
bacteria have also the property of coagulating or curdling
milk in an alkaline medium, and then digesting the curd.
A second class of bacteria has no effect on the complex
proteins just mentioned but readily attacks the products of
their first splitting, <i>i.e.</i>, the proteoses, peptones, polypeptids
and amino-acids. They are sometimes called <i class="term">saprophilic</i>
bacteria.</p>

<p>Other bacteria derive their nitrogen from some of the
products of the first two groups, and still further break down
the complex protein molecule. Under normal conditions
these various kinds of bacteria all occur together and thus
mutually assist one another in what is equivalent to a symbiosis
or rather a metabiosis, a “successive existence,” one
set living on the products of the other. The result is the
complete splitting up of the complete protein molecule. A
part of the nitrogen is built up into the bodies of the bacteria
which are using it as food. A part is finally liberated as
<i>free nitrogen</i> or as <i>ammonia</i> after having undergone a series
of transformations many of which are still undetermined.</p>

<p>One class of compounds formed received at one time
much attention because they were supposed to be responsible
for a great deal of illness. These are the “ptomaines,”
basic nitrogen compounds of definite composition&mdash;amines&mdash;some
few of which are poisonous, most of them not. The
basic character of ptomaines may be understood if they be
regarded as made up of one or more molecules of ammonia
in which the hydrogen has been replaced by alkyl or other
radicals. Thus ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) may be represented as
<img src="images/nh3.png" class="chemical" width="59" height="60" alt="NH3" title="NH3" />.
The simplest ptomaine is
<img src="images/ch3nh2.png" class="chemical" width="75" height="60" alt="CH3NH2" title="CH3NH2" />,
in which one H is replaced by methyl, methylamine, a gaseous ptomaine.
With two hydrogens replaced by methyl,
<img src="images/(ch3)2nh.png" class="chemical" width="77" height="60" alt="(CH3)2NH" title="(CH3)2NH" />,
dimethylamine, also a gas at ordinary temperature, is formed.
<a id="Page_104" class="pagenum" title="104"> </a>
Trimethylamine, <img src="images/n(ch3)3.png" class="chemical" width="76" height="60" alt="N(CH3)3" title="N(CH3)3" />,
a liquid, results when three hydrogens
are similarly replaced. All three of these occur in herring
brine and are responsible for the characteristic odor
of this material. Putrescin and cadaverin&mdash;tetramethylene&mdash;diamine,
and pentamethylenediamine respectively&mdash;occur
generally in decomposing flesh, hence the names.
They are only slightly poisonous. One of the highly poisonous
ptomaines is neurin C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>13</sub>NO or C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>OH = trimethyl-vinyl
ammonium hydroxide. This is a stronger
base than ammonia, liberating it from its salts. Numerous
other ptomaines have been isolated and described. These
bodies were considered for a long time to be the cause of
various kinds of “meat poisoning<!--TN: was 'posisoning'-->,” “ice cream poisoning,”
“cheese poisoning,” etc. It is true that they may
sometimes cause these conditions, but they are very much
rarer than the laity generally believe. Most of the “meat
poisonings” in America are due, not to ptomaines, but to
infections with certain bacilli of the <i class="taxonomy">Bacterium enteritidis</i>
group. Occasionally a case of poisoning by the true toxin
(see <a href="#CHAPTER_XII" class="int-ref">Chapter XII</a>) of <i class="taxonomy">Clostridium botulinum</i> occurs, and in
recent years has become entirely too common due to insufficient
heating of canned goods. <em>The boiling of such
material will destroy this toxin. The safest rule to follow is
not to eat any canned material that shows any departure from
the normal in flavor, taste or consistency.</em></p>

<p>As ptomaines result from the putrefaction of proteins, so
they are still further decomposed by bacteria and eventually
the nitrogen is liberated either as free nitrogen or
as ammonia.</p>

<p>Another series of products are the so-called aromatic
compounds&mdash;phenol (carbolic acid), various cresols, also
indol and skatol or methyl indol (these two are largely
responsible for the characteristic odor of human feces).
All of these nitrogen compounds are attacked by bacteria and
the nitrogen is eventually liberated, so far as it is not locked
up in the bodies of the bacteria, as free nitrogen or as ammonia.</p>

<p><a id="Page_105" class="pagenum" title="105"> </a>
The carbon which occurs in proteins accompanies the
nitrogen in many of the above products, but also appears in
nitrogen-free organic acids, aldehydes and alcohols which
are all eventually split up, so that the carbon is changed to
carbon dioxide or in the absence of oxygen partly to marsh
gas.</p>

<p>The intermediate changes which the sulphur in proteins
undergoes are not known, but it is liberated as sulphuretted
hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>S) or as various mercaptans (all foul-smelling),
or is partially oxidized to sulphuric acid. Some of the H<sub>2</sub>S
and the sulphur of the mercaptans are oxidized by the
sulphur bacteria to free sulphur and finally to sulphuric
acid.</p>

<p>Phosphorus is present especially in the nucleoproteins
and nucleins. Just what the intermediate stages are, on
whether there are any, so far as the phosphorus is concerned,
in the splitting up of nucleic acid by bacterial action is not
determined. The phosphorus may occur as phosphoric acid
in such decompositions, or when the conditions are
anaërobic, as phosphine (PH<sub>3</sub>), which burns spontaneously
in the air to phosphorus pentoxide (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), and water.<a id="Marker_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="marker" title="Footnote 13">13</a></p>

<p>The hydrogen in proteins appears in the forms above
indicated: H<sub>4</sub>C, H<sub>3</sub>N, H<sub>3</sub>P, H<sub>2</sub>S, H<sub>2</sub>O and as free H. The
oxygen as CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>In the breaking down of the complex protein molecule
even by a single kind of bacterium there is not a perfect
descending scale of complexity as might be supposed from
the statement that there result proteoses, peptones, polypeptids,
amino-acids. These substances do result, but at
the time of their formation simpler ones are formed also,
even CO<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>S. It appears that the entire molecule
is shattered in such a way that less complex proteins
are formed from the major part, while a minor portion breaks
up completely to the simplest combinations possible. A
more complete knowledge of these decompositions will aid
<a id="Page_106" class="pagenum" title="106"> </a>
in the further unravelling of the structure of proteins. The
presence or absence of free oxygen makes a difference in the
end-products, as has been indicated. There are bacteria
which oxidize the ammonia to nitric acid and the H<sub>2</sub>S to
sulphuric acid. (See <a href="#OXIDATION" class="int-ref">Oxidation</a>, Chapter XI.) Bacteria
which directly oxidize phosphorus compounds to phosphoric
acid have not been described. It does not seem that such
are necessary since this is either split off from nucleic acid
or results from the spontaneous oxidation of phosphine when
this is formed under anaërobic<!--TN: was 'anaerobic'--> conditions.</p>

<p>Not only are proteins decomposed as above outlined, but
also their waste products, that is, the form in which their
nitrogen leaves the animal body. This is largely urea in
mammals, with much hippuric acid in herbivorous animals
and uric acid in birds and reptiles. These substances yield
NH<sub>3</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O with a variety of organic acids as intermediate
products in some cases. The strong odor of ammonia
in stables and about manure piles is the everyday
evidence of this decomposition.</p>

<p>Where the putrefaction of proteins occurs in the soil with
moderate amounts of moisture and free access of air a large
part of the products is retained in the soil. Thus the ammonia
and carbon dioxide in the presence of water form
ammonium carbonate; the nitric, sulphuric and phosphoric
acids unite with some of the metals which are always present
to form salts. Some of the gases do escape and most where
the oxygen supply is least, since they are not oxidized.</p>

<p>The protein-splitting reactions afford valuable tests in
aiding in the recognition of bacteria. In the study of pathogenic
bacteria the coagulation and digestion of milk, the
digestion or liquefaction of blood serum, the liquefaction of
gelatin and the production of indol and H<sub>2</sub>S are those usually
tested for. In dairy bacteriology the coagulation of milk
and the digestion of the casein are common phenomena.
Most bacteria which liquefy gelatin also digest blood serum
and coagulate and digest milk, though there are exceptions.
In soil bacteriology the whole range of protein changes is of
the greatest importance.</p>

<p>The three physiological activities already discussed explain
how bacteria break down the chief complex, energy-rich
substances&mdash;carbohydrates, fats and proteins which
constitute the bulk of the organic material in the bodies of
plants and animals, as well as the waste products of the
latter&mdash;into energy-free compounds like carbon dioxide,
water, ammonia, nitric, sulphuric and phosphoric acids&mdash;mineralize
them, as is frequently said. By so doing the
bacteria act as the great scavengers of nature removing the
dead animal and vegetable matter of all kinds which but
for this action would accumulate to such an extent that all
life, both on land and in the water, must cease. It is further
to be noted that not only is all this dead organic matter
removed; but it is converted into forms which are again
available for plant growth. Carbon dioxide forms the source
of the carbon in all green plants, hence in all animals; the
sulphates and phosphates are likewise taken up by green
plants and built up again into protein compounds; the
ammonia is not directly available to green plants to any
large extent but is converted by the nitrifying bacteria
(<a href="#CHAPTER_XI" class="int-ref">Chapter XI</a>) into nitrates which is the form in which nitrogen
is assimilated by these higher types. Even the free
nitrogen of the air is taken up by several kinds of bacteria,
the symbiotic “root-tubercle bacteria” of leguminous and
other plants, and some free-living forms, and made available.
<a id="Page_109" class="pagenum" title="109"> </a>
Hence bacteria are indispensable in nature, especially
in keeping up the circulation of nitrogen. They are also
of great service in the circulation of carbon, sulphur and
phosphorus. Though some few kinds cause disease in man
and animals, if it were not for the saprophytic bacteria
above outlined, there could be no animals and higher plants
to acquire these diseases.</p>

PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES (<span class="smcap">Continued</span>).</h3>


<h4 id="PRODUCTION_OF_ACIDS">PRODUCTION OF ACIDS.</h4>

<p>The production of organic acids has been sufficiently discussed
in preceding chapters. It should be noted that not
only these in great variety are produced by bacteria but that
under certain conditions mineral acids, such as nitric, sulphuric
and phosphoric may be formed (see <a href="#OXIDATION" class="int-ref">Oxidation</a>, p.&nbsp;114).
Acid production is of great value in the identification of
bacteria in dairy and soil work and in connection with
certain types of pathogenic bacteria.</p>


<h4 id="GAS_PRODUCTION">GAS PRODUCTION.</h4>

<p>It will be sufficient merely to enumerate collectively the
various gases mentioned in preceding paragraphs and to
state that those commonly observed in the study of pathogenic
bacteria are the first six mentioned. Most of them
come in in dairy work either in the study of bacteria causing
milk and cheese “failures” or as affecting the flavors of
butter or cheese. In the study of soil organisms, any or all
of them are liable to be of importance. The gases are:
CO<sub>2</sub>, H, CH<sub>4</sub>, N, NH<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S, gaseous mercaptans, gaseous
ptomaines, volatile fatty acids, ethereal<!--TN: was 'etheral'--> salts or esters and
others, both of pleasant and of foul odor, but of unknown
composition.</p>


<h4 id="PRODUCTION_OF_ESTERS">PRODUCTION OF ESTERS.</h4>

<p>The production of esters, as mentioned in <a href="#CHAPTER_IX" class="int-ref">Chapters IX</a>
and <a href="#CHAPTER_X" class="int-ref">X</a>, of various alcohols and aldehydes are activities
which are sometimes of value in the study of bacteria, but
need not be further discussed.</p>
<a id="Page_111" class="pagenum" title="111"> </a>


<h4 id="PRODUCTION_OF_AROMATIC_COMPOUNDS">PRODUCTION OF “AROMATIC” COMPOUNDS.</h4>

<p>These have been mentioned in discussing the putrefaction
of proteins, as indol, skatol, phenol and various cresols.
Of these only the first is ordinarily tested for in the study
of bacteria, though others of the group become of value in
certain special cases.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig-72">
<img src="images/fig-72.jpg" width="274" height="500" alt="" /><br />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;72.</span>&mdash;Culture of phosphorescent bacteria in an Ehrlenmeyer flask
photographed by their own light. Time of exposure twelve hours. (Molisch,
from Lafar.)</div>
</div>


<h4 id="PHOSPHORESCENCE_OR_PHOTOGENESIS">PHOSPHORESCENCE OR PHOTOGENESIS.</h4>

<p>This is a most interesting phenomenon associated with
the growth of some bacteria. The “fox fire” frequently
seen on decaying wood which is covered with a slimy deposit
is most commonly due to bacteria, though also to other fungi.
Phosphorescent bacteria are very common in sea water,
hence they are frequently found on various sea foods, especially
<a id="Page_112" class="pagenum" title="112"> </a>
when these are allowed to decompose, such as fish,
oysters, clams, etc. The light is due to the conversion of
the energy of unknown easily oxidizable compounds directly
into <em>visible</em> radiant energy through oxidation without appreciable
quantities of heat. The light produced may be sufficient
to tell the time on a watch in absolute darkness, and
also to photograph the growths with their own light, but
only after several hours’ exposure (<a href="#fig-72" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;72</a>). None of the
phosphorescent bacteria so far discovered produce disease
in the higher animals or man.</p>


<h4 id="PRODUCTION_OF_PIGMENT_OR_CHROMOGENESIS">PRODUCTION OF PIGMENT OR CHROMOGENESIS.</h4>

<p>One of the most striking results of bacterial activity is
this phenomenon. The particular color which results may
be almost any one throughout the range of the spectrum,
though shades of yellow and of red are of more frequent
occurrence.</p>

<p>In the red sulphur bacteria the “bacteriopurpurin” which
they contain appears to serve as a true respiratory pigment
in a manner similar to the chlorophyl in green plants, except
that these bacteria oxidize H<sub>2</sub>S in the light as a source of
energy instead of splitting up CO<sub>2</sub>. The red pigment produced
by certain bacteria has been shown to have a capacity
for combining with O resembling that of hemoglobin, and
some investigators have believed that such bacteria do
store O in this way for use when the supply is diminished.
With these few exceptions the pigments seem to be merely
by-products of cell activity which are colored and have no
known function.</p>

<p>The red sulphur bacteria above mentioned and one or
two other kinds retain the pigments formed within the cell.
Such bacteria are called <i class="term">chromophoric</i> as distinguished from
the <i class="term">chromoparic</i> bacteria whose pigment lies outside the
cell.</p>

<p>The chemical composition of no bacterial pigment has
been determined up to the present. Some are soluble in
water, as shown by the discoloration of the substances on
which they grow. Others are not soluble in water but are
<a id="Page_113" class="pagenum" title="113"> </a>
in alcohol, or in some of the fat solvents as ether, chloroform,
benzol, etc. These latter are probably closely related
to the <i class="term">lipochromes</i> or “fat colors” of higher plants and
animals. Attempts have been made to render the production
of pigments a still more reliable means of identification
of species of bacteria through a careful examination of the
spectra of their solutions, but such study has not as yet led
to any valuable practical results.</p>

<p>The production of pigment depends on the same general
factors which determine the growth of the organism but does
<em>not necessarily run parallel</em> with these. It is especially influenced
by the oxygen supply (only a very few organisms
are known which produce pigment anaërobically&mdash;<i class="taxonomy">Spirillum
rubrum</i> is one); by the presence of certain food substances
(starch, as in potato, for many bacteria producing yellow and
red colors; certain mineral salts, as phosphates and sulphates,
for others); by the temperature (many bacteria
cease to produce color at all if grown at body temperature,
37°&mdash;<i class="taxonomy">Erythrobacillus prodigiosus</i>&mdash;or if grown for a longer
time at temperatures a few degrees higher).</p>


<h4 id="REDUCING_ACTIONS">REDUCING ACTIONS.</h4>

<p>Reduction of nitrates to nitrites or to ammonia or even
to free nitrogen is brought about by a great many different
kinds of bacteria. In many instances this phenomenon is
due to a lack of free oxygen, which is obtained by the bacteria
from these easily reducible salts. In other cases a
portion of the nitrogen is removed to be used as food material
in the building up of new protein in the bacterial cell. This
latter use of the nitrogen of nitrates by bacteria might
theoretically result in considerable loss of “available nitrogen”
in the soil as has actually been shown in a few experiments.
The reduction of nitrates as above mentioned
would also diminish this supply, but probably neither of
these results has any very great practical effect on soil fertility.
The building up of protein from these mineral salts
by bacteria in the intestines of herbivorous animals has been
suggested by Armsby as a considerable source of nitrogenous
food, and this suggestion appears possible.</p>

<p><a id="Page_114" class="pagenum" title="114"> </a>
The liberation of nitrogen from nitrates or nitrites, either
as free nitrogen or as ammonia, is spoken of as “dentrification,”
though this term was formerly applied to such liberations,
from compounds of nitrogen generally even from proteins.</p>

<p>Certain bacteria may also reduce sulphates and other
sulphur compounds to H<sub>2</sub>S, a phenomenon frequently observed
in sewage and likewise of importance in the soil.
It is possible that phosphates may be similarly reduced.<a id="Marker_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="marker" title="Footnote 14">14</a>
Further and more careful study of the reducing actions of
bacteria is needed.</p>


<h4 id="OXIDATION">OXIDATION.</h4>

<p>As has been stated in discussing the respiration of bacteria
(<a href="#CHAPTER_VIII" class="int-ref">Chapter VIII</a>) most of these organisms gain their
energy through the oxidation of carbon in various forms,
chiefly organic, so that CO<sub>2</sub> is a product of the activity of
nearly all bacteria. Some few oxidize CO to CO<sub>2</sub>, others
CH<sub>4</sub> and other paraffins to CO<sub>2</sub> for this purpose. One class
of bacteria even oxidizes H in small amounts for its energy
and uses the carbon dioxide of the air or traces of organic
carbon in the air as a source of carbon for “building” purposes.</p>

<p>One of the familiar oxidations of organic carbon is that
of the acetic acid bacteria in the making of vinegar. These
oxidize the alcohol which results from the action of yeast
to acetic acid according to the formula CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH + O<sub>2</sub> =
CH<sub>3</sub>COOH + H<sub>2</sub>O (see <a href="#fig-67" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;67</a>).</p>

<p>Of the various phenomena of oxidation due to bacteria,
the formation of nitrites and nitrates has the greatest practical
importance, since it is by this means that the ammonia
which results from the decomposition of animal and vegetable
tissue and waste products is again rendered available
to green plants as food in the form of nitrates. Practically
all the nitrates found in nature, sometimes in large quantities,
are formed in this way. There are two distinct kinds
of bacteria involved. One, the nitrous bacteria, oxidizes
the ammonia to nitrous acid which forms nitrites with bases,
and the other, the nitric bacteria, oxidizes the nitrous to
<a id="Page_115" class="pagenum" title="115"> </a>
nitric acid, giving nitrates with bases. A striking peculiarity
of these two classes of organisms is that they may live
entirely on inorganic food materials, are proto-autotrophic,
prototrophic for oxygen (aërobic) and autotrophic for the
other elements. Their carbon is derived from CO<sub>2</sub> or carbonates.
The importance of such organisms in keeping up
the supply of nitrates in the soil can scarcely be overestimated.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig-73">
<img src="images/fig-73.jpg" width="501" height="383" alt="" /><br />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;73.</span>&mdash;Sprinkling filters of the Columbus sewage-disposal plant&mdash;devices
which provide a good supply of oxygen for the bacteria that oxidize
the organic matter in the sewage.</div>
</div>

<p>The oxidation of the H<sub>2</sub>S, which is formed in the putrefaction
of proteins, to free S by the sulphur bacteria and the
further oxidation of this free S to sulphuric acid, and of the
phosphorus, so characteristic of the nucleins, to phosphoric
acid have been referred to. These activities of bacteria are
of great value in the soil. Doubtless the commercial “phosphate
rock” owes its origin to similar bacterial action in
ages past.</p>

<p><a id="Page_116" class="pagenum" title="116"> </a>
The oxidation of H<sub>2</sub>S to free S may be an explanation of
the origin of the great deposits of sulphur which are found
in Louisiana and along the Gulf coast. These deposits occur
in the same general regions as natural gas and oil. The
sulphur might have been derived from the same organic
material carried down by the Mississippi which yielded the
oil and gas.<a id="Marker_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="marker" title="Footnote 15">15</a></p>

<p>A purposeful utilization of the oxidizing power of bacteria
is in “contact beds,” “sprinkling filters” and “aërated
sludge tanks” in sewage disposal works. In these instances
the sewage is thoroughly mixed with air and brought in
contact with large amounts of porous material so as to expose
an extensive surface for oxidation (<a href="#fig-73" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;73</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig-74">
<img src="images/fig-74.jpg" width="500" height="231" alt="" /><br />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;74.</span>&mdash;One of the University hot beds.</div>
</div>


<h4 id="PRODUCTION_OF_HEAT">PRODUCTION OF HEAT.</h4>

<p>A direct result of the oxidizing action of bacteria is the
production of heat. Under most conditions of bacterial
growth this heat is not appreciable. It may become well
marked. The “heating” of manure is one of the commonest
illustrations. The temperature in such cases may reach
70°. The heating of hay and other green materials is due
chiefly to bacterial action. This heating may lead to “spontaneous
combustion.” The high temperatures (60° to 70°)
favor the growth of thermophil bacteria which cause a still
further rise. The heat dries out the material, portions of
which are in a state of very fine division due to the disintegrating
<a id="Page_117" class="pagenum" title="117"> </a>
action of the organisms. The hot, dry, finely
divided material oxidizes so rapidly on contact with the air
that it ignites.</p>

<p>A practical use of heat production by bacteria is in the
making of “hot beds” for forcing vegetables (<a href="#fig-74" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;74</a>).</p>


<h4 id="ABSORPTION_OF_FREE_NITROGEN">ABSORPTION OF FREE NITROGEN.</h4>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig-75">
<img src="images/fig-75.jpg" width="500" height="354" alt="" /><br />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;75.</span>&mdash;Root tubercles on soy bean. ×&nbsp;<span class="fraction"><sup>3</sup>⁄<sub>7</sub></span>.</div>
</div>

<p>This is likewise one of the most important practical
activities of certain types of bacteria present in the soil.
The ability of plants of the legume family to enrich the
soil has been known and taken advantage of for centuries,
but it is only about thirty years since it was demonstrated
that this property is due to bacteria. These plants, and
several other kinds as well, have on their roots larger or
smaller nodules (<a href="#fig-75" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;75</a>) spoken of as “root tubercles”
which are at certain stages filled with bacteria. When
conditions are favorable, these bacteria live in symbiotic
relationship with the plant tissues, receiving carbonaceous
and other food material from them and in return furnishing
<a id="Page_118" class="pagenum" title="118"> </a>
nitrogenous compounds to the plant. This nitrogenous
material is built up from free nitrogen absorbed from the
air by the bacteria. The utilization of this peculiar property
through the proper cultivation of clover, alfalfa, soy
beans and other legumes is one of the best ways of building
up and maintaining soil fertility in so far as the nitrogen is
concerned. The technical name of these bacteria is <i class="taxonomy">Rhizobium
leguminosarum</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig-76">
<img src="images/fig-76.jpg" width="252" height="250" alt="" /><br />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;76.</span>&mdash;Free-living nitrogen absorbing bacteria “Azotobacter.” Note
their large size as compared with other bacteria shown in this book.</div>
</div>

<p>There are also types of “free-living,” as distinguished
from these symbiotic, bacteria which absorb the free nitrogen
of the air and aid materially in keeping up this supply
under natural conditions. One of the most important of
these types is the aërobic “Azotobacter” (<a href="#fig-76" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;76</a>), while
another is the anaërobic <i class="taxonomy">Clostridium pasteurianum</i>. The
nitrogen which is absorbed is built up into the protein
material of the cell body and this latter must in all probability
be “worked over” by various types of decomposition
bacteria and by the nitrous and nitric organisms and be
converted into utilizable nitrates just as other protein
material is, as has been discussed in <a href="#CHAPTER_X" class="int-ref">Chapter X</a>. At any
rate there is as yet no definite knowledge of any other
method of transformation. Up to the present no intentional
practical utilization of this valuable property of these free-living
forms has been made.</p>

<p><b>Nitrogen Nutrition of Green Plants.</b>&mdash;It is the belief of
botanists that green plants obtain their nitrogen chiefly
in the form of nitrates, though ammonium salts may be
<a id="Page_119" class="pagenum" title="119"> </a>
utilized to some extent by certain plants at least. Exceptions
to this general rule are those plants provided with
root tubercles (and the bog plants and others which have
mycorrhiza?). These plants obtain their nitrogen in the
form of organic compounds made for them by the bacteria
growing in the tubercles. That nitrogen circulates throughout
the structure of plants in organic combination is certain.
There does not appear to be any reason why similar compounds
which are soluble and diffusible (amino-acids?)
should not be taken up through the roots of plants and
utilized as such. <em>It seems to the author that this is very probably
the case.</em> Arguments in favor of this view are: (1) The
nitrogen nutrition of leguminous and other plants with root
nodules. (2) The close symbiosis between “Azotobacter”
and similar nitrogen-absorbing bacteria and many species
of algæ in sea water at least. (3) The vigorous growth of
plants in soils very rich in organic matter, which inhibits
the production of nitrates by the nitrous-nitric bacteria
when grown in culture, and possibly (?) in the soil, so that
nitrates may not account for the vigorous growth. (4) The
effect of nitrate fertilizers is to add an amount of nitrogen
to the crop much in excess of the amount added as
nitrate. (5) The most fertile soils contain the largest numbers
of bacteria. The doctrine that nitrates furnish the
only nitrogen to plants was established before the activities
of bacteria in the soil were suspected, and, so far as the
author is aware, has not been supported by experiments
under conditions rigidly controlled as to sterility.</p>

<p>It would seem that one of the chief functions of soil bacteria
is to prepare soluble organic compounds of nitrogen
for the use of green plants and thus to make a “short cut”
in the nitrogen cycle (<a href="#Page_107" class="int-ref">p.&nbsp;107</a>), as now believed in, direct
from the “decomposition bacteria” to green plants.</p>

<p>Experiments have been made by different observers in
growing seedling plants of various kinds in water culture
with one or in some cases several of the amino-acids as
sources of nitrogen. Most of these experiments were disappointing.
Plant proteins are not so different from animal
proteins, or plant protoplasm (apart from the chlorophyl
<a id="Page_120" class="pagenum" title="120"> </a>
portions of plants) from animal protoplasm as to lead one to
suppose that it could be built up from one or two amino-acids
any more than animal protoplasm can. The author
is strongly convinced that this subject should be thoroughly
investigated. It will require careful experimentation and
perhaps rather large funds to provide the amounts of amino-acids
that would probably be needed, but might result in a
decided change in our ideas of soil fertility, and especially
in the use of nitrogen fertilizers.</p>

PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES (<span class="smcap">Continued</span>).</h3>


<h4 id="PRODUCTION_OF_ENZYMES">PRODUCTION OF ENZYMES.</h4>

<p>Most of the physiological activities of bacteria which
have been discussed are due to the action of these peculiar
substances, so that a knowledge of their properties is essential.
This knowledge cannot as yet be exact because no
enzyme has, up to the present, been obtained in a “pure
state,” though it must be admitted that there are no certain
criteria which will enable this “pure state” to be recognized.
It was formerly thought that they were protein in nature,
but very “pure” and active enzymes have been prepared
which did not give the characteristic protein reactions, so
this idea must be abandoned. That they are large moleculed
colloidal substances closely related to the proteins in
many respects must still be maintained. There are certain
characteristics which belong to enzymes, though no one of
them exclusively. These may be enumerated as follows:</p>

<p>1. Enzymes are <em>dead</em> organic chemical substances.</p>

<p><em>Dead</em> is used in the sense of non-living, never having
lived, not in the sense of “ceased to be alive.”</p>

<p>2. They are always produced by <em>living</em> cells:</p>

<p>Sometimes as active enzymes, sometimes as <i class="term">pro-enzymes</i>
or <i class="term">zymogens</i> which are converted into enzymes outside the
cell by acids, other inorganic substances or other enzymes.</p>

<p>3. They produce very great chemical changes without
themselves being appreciably affected.</p>

<p>Enzymes will not continue to act indefinitely, but are
used up in the process (combination with products?). The
amount of change is so great in proportion to the amount of
enzyme that the above statement is justified in the relative
sense. Thus a milk-curdling enzyme has been prepared
<a id="Page_122" class="pagenum" title="122"> </a>
that would precipitate 100,000,000 times its own weight of
caseinogen.</p>

<p>4. Their action is specific in that each enzyme acts on
one kind of chemical substance only, and the products are
always the same.</p>

<p>The substance may be combined with a variety of other
chemical substances so that the action appears to be on
several, but in reality it is on a definite group of molecules
in each instance. For example, emulsin attacks several
different glucosides but always sets free dextrose from them.</p>

<p>5. The action is inhibited and eventually stopped, and in
some cases the enzyme is destroyed by an accumulation of
the products of the action. If the products are removed, the
action will continue, if the enzyme is not destroyed. This
effect is explained partly because the enzyme probably
combines with some of the products, since it does not act
indefinitely, and partly because of the reversibility of the
reaction.</p>

<p>6. Like many chemical reactions those of enzymes are
reversible, that is, the substance broken up may be reformed
by it from the products produced in many instances. Thus:</p>

<div class="equation">
<span class="no-wrap">maltose + maltase ⇆ glucose + glucose + maltase.</span>
</div>

<div class="equation">
<span class="no-wrap">fat + lipase ⇆ glycerin + fatty acid + lipase.</span>
</div>

<p>7. The presence of certain mineral salts seems to be
essential for their action. These and other substances which
are necessary are sometimes called <i class="term">co-enzymes</i>. A salt of
calcium is most favorable for a great many.</p>

<p>8. They may be adsorbed like other colloids by “shaking
out” with finely divided suspensions like charcoal or kaolin,
or by other colloids like aluminum hydroxide or proteins.</p>

<p>9. When properly introduced into the tissues or blood of
an animal, they cause the body cells to form <i class="term">anti-enzymes</i>
which will prevent the action of the enzyme (see <a href="#CHAPTER_XXVII" class="int-ref">Chapter
XXVII</a>).</p>

<p>10. Though inert, they show many of the characteristics
of living organisms, that is</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Each enzyme has an optimum, a maximum and a
minimum temperature for its action.</p>

<p><a id="Page_123" class="pagenum" title="123"> </a>
All chemical reactions have such temperature limits, the
distinction is that for enzymes as for living substance the
<i>range</i> is relatively narrow.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) High temperatures destroy enzymes. All in water
are destroyed by boiling in time and most at temperatures
considerably below the boiling-point. When dry, many will
withstand a higher degree of heat than 100° before they are
destroyed.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Temperatures below the minimum stop their action,
though they are not destroyed by cold.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Many poisons and chemical disinfectants (<a href="#CHAPTER_XIV" class="int-ref">Chapter
XIV</a>) which kill living organisms will also stop the action of
enzymes, though generally more of the substance is required,
so that it is possible to destroy the living cells by such means
and yet the action of the enzyme will continue.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Most enzymes have an optimum reaction of medium
either acid, alkaline or neutral, depending on the particular
enzyme, though some few seem to act equally well within a
considerable range on either side of the neutral point.</p>

<p><em>The final test for an enzyme is the chemical change it brings
about in the specific substance acted on.</em></p>

<p>The most prominent characteristic of enzymes is that
they bring about very great chemical changes without themselves
being appreciably affected. This property is also
shown by many inorganic substances which are spoken of
as “catalytic agents” or “catalyzers” so that enzymes are
sometimes called “organic catalyzers.” The function of
catalytic agents seems to be to hasten the rate of a reaction
which would occur spontaneously, though in a great many
cases with extreme slowness.</p>

<p>Just how enzymes act is not certain and probably will not
be until their composition and constitution are known.
Most probably they form a combination with the substance
acted on (<i class="term">the substrate</i>) as a result of which there is a rearrangement
of the atoms in such a way that new compounds
are formed, nearly always at least two, and the enzyme is
at the same time set free. It is rather remarkable that
chiefly optically active substances are split up by enzymes
and where two modifications exist it is usually the dextro-rotatory
<a id="Page_124" class="pagenum" title="124"> </a>
one which is attacked. No single enzyme attacks
both. This probably means that the structure of the
enzyme corresponds to that of the substrate, “fits it as a
key fits a lock,” as Emil Fischer says.</p>

<p>The production of enzymes is by no means restricted to
bacteria since all kinds of living cells that have been investigated
have been shown to produce them and presumably
<em>all</em> living cells do. Hence the number of different kinds of
enzymes and of substances acted upon is practically unlimited.
Nevertheless they may be grouped into a comparatively
few classes based on the general character of the
change brought about by them.</p>

<p>I. Class I is the so-called <i class="term">“splitting” enzymes</i> whose
action is for the most part hydrolytic, that is, the substance
takes up water and then splits into compounds that were apparently
constituents of the original molecule. As examples
may be mentioned <i class="term">diastase</i>, the enzyme first discovered,
which changes starch into a malt-sugar, hence is more commonly
called <i class="term">amylase</i><a id="Marker_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="marker" title="Footnote 16">16</a> (starch-splitting enzyme); <i class="term">invertase</i>,<a href="#Footnote_16" class="marker" title="Footnote 16">16</a>
which splits cane-sugar into dextrose and levulose: C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>
+ H<sub>2</sub>O = C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>. <i class="term">Lipase</i><a href="#Footnote_16" class="marker" title="Footnote 16">16</a> or a fat-splitting
enzyme, which decomposes fat into glycerin and fatty acid:</p>

<div class="equation"><!--TN: common name printed below formula in original text-->
<span class="formula"><small>Fat</small><br />
C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(OC<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n-1</sub>O)<sub>3</sub></span>
+
<span class="formula">3H<sub>2</sub>O</span>
=
<span class="formula"><small>Glycerin</small><br />
C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>3</sub></span>
+
<span class="formula"><small>Fatty acid</small><br />
3C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</span>
</div>

<p class="continued"><i class="term">Proteases</i>, which split up proteins into proteoses and peptones.</p>

<p>Other classes of “splitting enzymes” break up the products
of complex protein decomposition, such as proteoses,
peptones and amino-acids. A variety of the “splitting
enzymes” is the group of</p>

<p><i class="term">“Coagulases” or coagulating enzymes</i> as the rennet (lab,
chymosin) which curdles milk; fibrin ferment (thrombin,
thrombase) which causes the coagulation of blood. These
apparently act by splitting up a substance in the fluids
mentioned, after which splitting one of the new products
formed combines with other compounds present (usually a
<a id="Page_125" class="pagenum" title="125"> </a>
mineral salt, and in the cases mentioned a calcium salt) to
form an insoluble compound, the curd or coagulum.</p>

<p><i class="term">Another variety is the “activating” enzymes or “kinases”</i>
such as the enterokinase of the intestine. The action here
is a splitting of the <i class="term">zymogen</i> or mother substance or form in
which the enzyme is built up by the cell so as to liberate the
active enzyme.</p>

<p>Of a character quite distinct, from the splitting enzymes
are</p>

<p>II. The <i class="term">zymases</i>. Their action seems to be to cause a
“shifting on rearrangement of the carbon atoms” so that new
compounds are formed which are not assumed to have
been constituents of the original molecule. Most commonly
there is a closer combination of the carbon and oxygen
atoms, frequently even the formation of CO<sub>2</sub> so that considerable
energy is thus liberated. Examples are the <i class="term">zymase</i>
or <i class="term">alcoholase</i> of yeast which converts sugar into alcohol and
carbon dioxide; C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> = 2C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O + 2CO<sub>2</sub>: also <i class="term">urease</i>,
which causes the change of urea into ammonia and carbon
dioxide. Another common zymase is the <i class="term">lactacidase</i> in
lactic acid fermentation.</p>

<p>III. <i class="term">Oxidizing enzymes</i> also play an important part in
many of the activities of higher plants and animals. Among
the bacteria this action is illustrated by the formation of
nitrites, nitrates and sulphates and the oxidation of alcohol
to acetic acid as already described.</p>

<p>IV. <i class="term">Reducing enzymes</i> occur in many of the dentrifying
bacteria and in those which liberate H<sub>2</sub>S from sulphates.
A very widely distributed reducing enzyme is “catalase”
which decomposes hydrogen peroxide.</p>

<p>As previously stated, most of the physiological activities
of bacteria are due to the enzymes that they produce. It is
evident that for action to occur on substances which do
not diffuse into the bacterial cell&mdash;starches, cellulose, complex
proteins, gelatin&mdash;the enzymes must <em>pass out</em> of the
bacterium and consequently may be found in the surrounding
medium. Substances like sugars, peptones, alcohol,
which are readily diffusible, may be acted on by enzymes
<em>retained within</em> the cell body. In the former case the enzymes
<a id="Page_126" class="pagenum" title="126"> </a>
are spoken of as extra-cellular or “<i class="term">exo-enzymes</i>,”
and in the latter as intra-cellular or “<i class="term">endo-enzymes</i>.” The
endo-enzymes and doubtless also the exo-enzymes may after
the death of the cell digest the contents to a greater or less
extent and thus furnish substances that are not otherwise
obtainable. This process of “self-digestion” is known technically
as “<i class="term">autolysis</i>.”</p>

<p>A distinction was formerly made between “organized”
and “unorganized ferments.” The former term was applied
to the minute living organisms, bacteria, yeasts, molds,
etc., which bring about characteristic fermentative changes,
while the latter term was restricted to enzymes as just
described. Since investigation has shown that the changes
ascribed to the “organized ferments” are really due to their
enzymes, and that enzymes are probably formed by all living
cells, the distinction is scarcely necessary at present.</p>


<h4 id="PRODUCTION_OF_TOXINS">PRODUCTION OF TOXINS.</h4>

<p>The injurious effects of pathogenic bacteria are due in
large part to the action of these substances, which in many
respects bear a close relationship to enzymes. The chemical
composition is unknown since no toxin has been prepared
“pure” as yet. It was formerly thought that they were
protein in character, but very pure toxins have been prepared
which failed to show the characteristic protein reactions.
It is well established that they are complex substances,
of rather large molecule and are precipitated by
many of the reagents which precipitate proteins. Toxins
will be further discussed in <a href="#CHAPTER_XXVII" class="int-ref">Chapter XXVII</a>. It will be
sufficient at this point to enumerate their chief peculiarities
in order to show their marked resemblance to enzymes.</p>

<p>1. Toxins are <em>dead</em> organic chemical substances.</p>

<p>2. They are always produced by <em>living</em> cells.</p>

<p>3. They are active poisons in <em>very small quantities</em>.<a id="Marker_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="marker" title="Footnote 17">17</a></p>

<p>4. Their action is specific in that each toxin acts on a
particular kind of cell. The fact that a so-called toxin acts
<a id="Page_127" class="pagenum" title="127"> </a>
on several different kinds of cells, possibly indicates a mixture
of several toxins, or action on the <em>same substance</em> in the
cells.</p>

<p>5. Toxins are very sensitive to the action of injurious
agencies such as heat, light, etc., and in about the same
measure that enzymes are, though as a rule they are somewhat
more sensitive or “labile.”</p>

<p>6. Toxins apparently have maxima, optima, and minima
of temperature for their action, as shown by the destructive
effect of heat and by the fact that a frog injected with tetanus
toxin and kept at 20° shows no indication of poison,
but if the temperature is raised to 37°, symptoms of poisoning
are soon apparent. Cold, however, does not destroy a
toxin.</p>

<p>7. When properly introduced into the tissues of animals
they cause the body cells to form antitoxins (<a href="#CHAPTER_XXVII" class="int-ref">Chapter
XXVII</a>) which are capable of preventing the action of the
toxin in question.</p>

<p>8. <em>The determining test for a toxin is its action on a living
cell.</em></p>

<p>It is true that enzymes are toxic, as are also various
foreign proteins, when injected into an animal, but in much
larger<!--TN: was 'large'--> doses than are toxins.</p>

<p>A marked difference between enzymes and toxins is that
the former may bring about a very great chemical change
and still may be recovered from the mixture of substances
acted on and produced, while the toxin seems to be permanently
used up in its toxic action and cannot be so recovered.
<em>Toxins seem very much like enzymes whose action is restricted
to living cells.</em></p>

<p>Just as enzymes are probably produced by all kinds of
cells and not by bacteria alone, so toxins are produced
by other organisms. Among toxins which have been carefully
studied are <i class="term">ricin</i>, the poison of the castor oil plant
(<i class="taxonomy">Ricinus communis</i>); <i class="term">abrin</i> of the jequirity bean (<i class="taxonomy">Abrus precatorius</i>);
<i class="term">robin</i> of the common locust (<i class="taxonomy">Robinia pseudacacia</i>);
poisons of spiders, scorpions, bees, fish, snakes and salamanders.</p>

<p>It has been stated that some enzymes are thrown out
from the cell and others are retained within the cell. The
<a id="Page_128" class="pagenum" title="128"> </a>
same is true of toxins, hence we speak of <i class="term">exo-toxins</i> or toxins
excreted from, and <i class="term">endo-toxins</i> or toxins retained within the
cell. Among the pathogenic bacteria there are very few
which secrete toxins when growing outside the body. <i class="taxonomy">Clostridium
tetani</i> or lockjaw bacillus, <i class="taxonomy">Corynebacterium diphtheriæ</i> or
the diphtheria bacillus, <i class="taxonomy">Clostridium botulinum</i> or a bacillus
causing a type of food poisoning, <i class="taxonomy">Pseudomonas pyocyanea</i> or
the blue pus bacillus are the most important. Other pathogenic
bacteria do not secrete their toxins under the above
conditions, but only give them up when the cell is disintegrated
either within or outside the body. For the reason
that endotoxins are therefore difficult to obtain, their characteristics
have not been much studied. The description of
toxins as above given is intended to apply to the <i class="term">exo-toxins</i>
of bacteria, sometimes spoken of as <i class="term">true toxins</i>, and to the
vegetable toxins (phytotoxins) which resemble them.</p>

<p>The snake venoms and probably most of the animal toxins
(zoötoxins) are very different substances. (See <a href="#CHAPTER_XXIX" class="int-ref">Chapter
XXIX.</a>)</p>


<h4 id="CAUSATION_OF_DISEASE">CAUSATION OF DISEASE.</h4>

<p>This subject belongs properly in special pathogenic bacteriology.
It will be sufficient to indicate that bacteria may
cause disease in one or more of the following ways: (<i>a</i>)
blocking circulatory vessels, either blood or lymph, directly
or indirectly; (<i>b</i>) destruction of tissue; (<i>c</i>) production of
non-specific poisons (ptomaines, bases, nitrites, acids, gases,
etc.); (<i>d</i>) production of specific poisons (toxins).</p>


<h4 id="ANTIBODY_FORMATION">ANTIBODY FORMATION.</h4>

<p>Bacteria cause the formation of specific “antibodies” when
properly introduced into animals. This must be considered
as a physiological activity since it is by means of substances
produced within the bacterial cell that the body cells of
animals are stimulated to form antibodies. (See <a href="#CHAPTER_XXVI" class="int-ref">Chapters
XXVI&ndash;XXIX</a>.)</p>
<a id="Page_129" class="pagenum" title="129"> </a>


<h4 id="STAINING">STAINING.</h4>

<p>The reaction of bacteria to various stains is dependent on
their physico-chemical structure and hence is a result of
physiological processes, but is best discussed separately
(<a href="#CHAPTER_XIX" class="int-ref">Chapter XIX</a>).</p>


<h4 id="CULTURAL_CHARACTERISTICS">CULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS.</h4>

<p>The same is true of the appearance and growth on different
culture media. (<a href="#CHAPTER_XX" class="int-ref">Chapter XX</a>.)</p>

DISINFECTION&mdash;STERILIZATION&mdash;DISINFECTANTS.</h3>


<p>The discussion of the physiology of bacteria in the preceding
chapters has shown that a number of environmental
factors must be properly correlated in order that a given
organism may thrive. Conversely, it can be stated that any
one of these environmental factors may be so varied that
the organism will be more or less injured, may even be
destroyed by such variation. It has been the thorough study
of the above-mentioned relationships which has led to practical
methods for destroying bacteria, for removing them or
preventing their growth when such procedures become
necessary.</p>

<p>The process of killing all the living organisms or of removing
them completely is spoken of as <i class="term">disinfection</i> or as <i class="term">sterilization</i>,
according to circumstances. Thus the latter term is
applied largely in the laboratory, while the former more
generally in practice outside the laboratory. So also disinfection
is most commonly done with chemical agents and
sterilization by physical means, though exceptions are
numerous. The original idea of disinfection was the destruction
of “infective” organisms, that is, organisms producing
disease in man or animals. A wider knowledge of bacteriology
has led to the application of the term to the destruction
of other organisms as well. Thus the cheese-maker
“disinfects” his curing rooms to prevent abnormal ripening of
cheese, and the dairy-worker “disinfects” his premises to
avoid bad flavors, abnormal changes in the butter or milk.
<i class="term">Sterilization</i> is more commonly applied to relatively small
objects and <i class="term">disinfection</i> to larger ones. Thus in the laboratory,
instruments, glassware, apparatus, etc., are “sterilized”
while desks, walls and floors are “disinfected.” The surgeon
<a id="Page_131" class="pagenum" title="131"> </a>
“sterilizes” his instruments, but “disinfects” his
operating table and room. The dairy-workers mentioned
above sterilize their apparatus, pails, milk bottles, etc.
Evidently the object of the two processes is the same, removing
or destroying living organisms, the name to be applied
is largely a question of usage and circumstances. Any agent
which is used to destroy microörganisms is called a “disinfectant.”
Material freed from <em>living</em> organisms is “sterile.”</p>

<p>The process of <em>preventing the growth</em> of organisms without
reference to whether they are killed or removed is spoken
of as “<i class="term">antisepsis</i>,” and the agent as an <i class="term">antiseptic</i>. Hence a
mildly applied “disinfectant” becomes an “antiseptic,”
though it does not necessarily follow that an “antiseptic”
may become a disinfectant<!--TN: was 'disfectant'--> when used abundantly. Thus
strong sugar solutions prevent the development of many
organisms, though they do not necessarily kill them.</p>

<p><i class="term">Asepsis</i> is a term which is restricted almost entirely to
surgical operations and implies the taking of such precautions
that foreign organisms are <em>kept out</em> of the field of operation.
Such an operation is an <i class="term">aseptic</i> one, or performed
<i class="term">aseptically</i>.</p>

<p>A “deodorant or deodorizer” is used to destroy or remove
an odor and does not necessarily have either antiseptic or
disinfectant properties.</p>

<p>The agents which are used for the above-described processes
may be conveniently divided into <i class="term">physical agents</i> and
<i class="term">chemical agents</i>.</p>


<h4 id="PHYSICAL_AGENTS">PHYSICAL AGENTS.</h4>

<p><b>1. Drying.</b>&mdash;This is doubtless the oldest method for <em>preventing
the growth</em> of organisms, and the one which is used
on the greatest amount of material at the present time. A
very large percentage of commercial products is preserved
and transported intact because the substances are kept free
from moisture. In the laboratory many materials which
are used as food for bacteria (see <a href="#CHAPTER_XVI" class="int-ref">Chapter XVI</a>) “keep”
because they are dry. Nevertheless, drying should be considered
<a id="Page_132" class="pagenum" title="132"> </a>
as an <i class="term">antiseptic</i> rather than as a <i class="term">disinfectant</i> process.
While it is true that the <em>complete</em> removal of water would
result in the death of all organisms this necessitates a high
temperature, in itself destructive, and does not occur in
practice. Further, though many pathogenic bacteria are
killed by drying, many more, including the spore formers,
are not. Hence drying alone is not a practical method of
<i class="term">disinfecting</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig-77">
<img src="images/fig-77.jpg" width="400" height="403" alt="" /><br />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;77.</span>&mdash;A small laboratory hot-air sterilizer.</div>
</div>

<p><b>2. Heat.</b>&mdash;The use of heat in some form is one of the
very best means for destroying bacteria. It may be made
use of by combustion, or burning, as direct exposure to the
open flame, as dry heat (hot air), or as moist heat (boiling
water or steam). Very frequently in veterinary practice,
especially in the country, occasionally under other conditions,
the infected material is best burned. This method is
thoroughly effective and frequently the cheapest in the end.
Wherever there are no valid objections it should be used.
Exposure to the open flame is largely a laboratory procedure
to sterilize small metallic instruments and even small pieces
of glassware. It is an excellent procedure in postmortem
examinations to burn off the surface of the body or of an
<a id="Page_133" class="pagenum" title="133"> </a>
organ when it is desired to obtain bacteria from the interior
free from contamination with surface organisms.</p>

<p><i>Dry Heat.</i>&mdash;Dry heat is not nearly so effective as moist
heat as a sterilizing agent. The temperature must be higher
and continued longer to accomplish the same result. Thus
a dry heat of 150° for thirty minutes is no more efficient than
steam under pressure at 115° for fifteen minutes. Various
forms of hot-air sterilizers are made for laboratory purposes
(<a href="#fig-77" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;77</a>). On account of the greater length of time required
for sterilization their use is more and more restricted to
objects which must be used dry, as in blood and serum
work, for example. In practice the use of hot air in disinfecting
plants is now largely restricted to objects which
might be injured by steam, as leather goods, furs, and certain
articles of furniture, but even here chemical agents are
more frequently used.</p>

<p><i>Moist Heat.</i>&mdash;Moist heat may be applied either by boiling
in water or by the use of steam at air pressure, or, for
rapid work and on substances that would not be injured,
by steam under pressure. Boiling is perhaps the best household
method for disinfecting all material which can be so
treated. The method is simple, can always be made use of,
and is universally understood. It must be remembered that
all pathogenic organisms, even their spores, are destroyed
by a few minutes’ boiling. The process may be applied to
more resistant organisms, such as are met with in canning
vegetables, though the boiling must be continued for several
hours, or what is better, repeated on several different days.
This latter process, known as “<i class="term">discontinuous sterilization</i>,”
or “<i class="term">tyndallization</i>,” must also be applied to substances
which would be injured or changed in composition by too
long-continued heating, such as gelatin, milk, and certain
sugars. In the laboratory such materials are boiled or subjected
to steaming steam for half an hour on each of three
successive days. In canning vegetables the boiling should
be from one to two hours each day. The principle involved
is that the first boiling destroys the growing cells, but not
all spores. Some of the latter germinate by the next day
and are then killed by the second boiling and the remainder
<a id="Page_134" class="pagenum" title="134"> </a>
develop and are killed on the third day. Occasionally a
fourth boiling is necessary. It is also true that repeated
heating and cooling is more destructive to bacteria than
continuous heating for the same length of time, but the
development of the spores is the more important factor.
Discontinuous heating may also be used at temperatures
below the boiling-point for the sterilization of fluids like
blood serum which would be coagulated by boiling. In
this case the material is heated at 55° to 56° for one hour,
but on each of seven to ten successive days. The intermittent
heating and cooling is of the same importance as
the development of the spores in this case. (Better results
are secured with such substances by collecting them aseptically
in the first place.)</p>

<p><i>Steam.</i>&mdash;Steam is one of the most commonly employed
agents for sterilization and disinfection. It is used either
as “streaming steam” at air pressure or confined under
pressure so that the temperature is raised. For almost all
purposes where boiling is applicable streaming steam may
<a id="Page_135" class="pagenum" title="135"> </a>
be substituted. It is just as efficient and frequently more
easily applied. The principle of the numerous forms of
“steam sterilizers” (<a href="#fig-78" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;78</a>) is essentially the same. There
<a id="Page_136" class="pagenum" title="136"> </a>
is a receptacle for a relatively small quantity of water and
means for conducting the steam generated by boiling this
water to the objects to be treated, which are usually placed
immediately above the water. Surgical instruments may
be most conveniently sterilized by boiling or by steaming in
especially constructed instrument sterilizers. If boiled, the
addition of carbonate of soda, about 1 per cent., usually
prevents injury.</p>

student laboratories. Steam is furnished direct from the University central
heating plant.</div>
</div>

<p><i>Steam under pressure</i> affords a much more rapid and certain
method of destroying organisms. Fifteen to twenty
pounds pressure corresponding to temperatures of 121° to
125° is commonly used. Variations depend on the bulk and
nature of the material. Apparatus for this purpose may now
<a id="Page_137" class="pagenum" title="137"> </a>
be obtained from sizes as small as one or two gallons up to
huge structures which will take one or two truckloads of
material (<a href="#fig-79" class="int-ref">Figs.&nbsp;79&ndash;91</a>). The latter type is in common use
in canning factories, dairy plants, hospitals, public institutions,
municipal and governmental disinfecting stations.
Very frequently there is an apparatus attached for producing
a vacuum, both to exhaust the air before sterilizing,
so that the steam penetrates much more quickly and thoroughly
and for removing the vapor after sterilizing, thus
hastening the drying out of the material disinfected.</p>

</div>

<p>The smaller types of pressure sterilizers are called “autoclaves”
and have become indispensable in laboratory work.
Fifteen pounds pressure maintained for fifteen minutes is
commonly sufficient for a few small objects. For larger
masses much longer time is needed. The author found that
<a id="Page_138" class="pagenum" title="138"> </a>
in an autoclave of the type shown in <a href="#fig-81" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;81</a> it required ten
minutes for 500&nbsp;cc. of water at 15 pounds pressure to reach
a temperature of 100°, starting at room temperatures, 20° to
25°. Autoclaves may be used as simple steam sterilizers by
leaving the escape valves open so that the steam is not
confined, hence they have largely replaced the latter.<a id="Marker_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="marker" title="Footnote 18">18</a></p>

<a id="Page_140" class="pagenum" title="140"> </a>
vary but are essentially two in principle. 1. The material
in small quantities in suitable containers (bottles) is placed

and maintained for twenty to thirty minutes and then the

whole is cooled (beer, wine, grape juice, bottled milk) (<a href="#fig-92" class="int-ref">Figs.&nbsp;92</a>,

<p>2. Pasteurizing machines are used and the fluid flows
through continuously. In one type the temperature is

<a id="Page_143" class="pagenum" title="143"> </a>
raised to 60° and by “retarders” is kept at this temperature

<b>3. Cold.</b>&mdash;That <i>cold</i> is an excellent <i class="term">antiseptic</i> is illustrated
by the general use of refrigerators and “cold storage.”
Numerous experiments have shown that although many
pathogenic organisms of a given kind are killed by temperatures
below freezing, not all of the same kind are, and many
kinds are only slightly affected. Hence cold cannot be considered
a practical means for <i class="term">disinfection</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><b>4. Light.</b>&mdash;It has been stated (<a href="#Page_75" class="int-ref">p.&nbsp;75</a>) that light is destructive
to bacteria, and the advisability of having well-lighted
habitations for men and animals has been mentioned. The
practice of “sunning” bedclothing, hangings and other large
articles which can scarcely be disinfected in a more convenient
way is the usual method of employing this agent.
Drying and the action of the oxygen of the air assist the
process to some extent. Undoubtedly large numbers of
pathogenic organisms are destroyed under natural conditions
by the combined effects of drying, direct sunlight and
<a id="Page_149" class="pagenum" title="149"> </a>
oxidation, but it should not be forgotten that a very slight
protection will prevent the action of light (<a href="#fig-100" class="int-ref">Figs.&nbsp;100</a> and <a href="#fig-101" class="int-ref">101</a>).</p>

in the usual way. A letter <i>H</i> of black paper was pasted on the bottom.
The plate was then exposed for four hours to the sun in January outside the
window and then incubated. The black paper protected the bacteria. Outside
of it they were killed except where they happened to be in large masses.
Hence the letter shows distinctly. (Student preparation.)</div>
</div>

<p><b>5. Osmotic Pressure.</b>&mdash;Increase in the concentration of
substances in solution is in practical use as an <i class="term">antiseptic</i>
procedure. Various kinds of “sugar preserves,” salt meats
and condensed milk are illustrations. It must be remembered
that a similar increase in concentration occurs when
many substances are dried, and is probably as valuable in
the preservative action as the loss of water. That the process
cannot be depended on to <em>kill</em> even pathogenic organisms
is shown by finding living tubercle bacilli in condensed
milk. The placing of bacteria in water or in salt solution
in order to have them die and disintegrate (greatly aided
by vigorous shaking in a shaking machine) (“autolysis,”
<a id="Page_150" class="pagenum" title="150"> </a>
<a href="#Page_126" class="int-ref">p.&nbsp;126</a>) is a laboratory procedure to obtain cell constituents.
It is not a practical method of disinfection, however.</p>

It is evident that few of the bacteria were killed, since the letter <i>L</i> is barely
outlined. The exposure was at the same time as the plate in <a href="#fig-100" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;100</a>. (Student
preparation.)</div>
</div>

<p><b>6. Electricity.</b>&mdash;Electricity, though not in itself injurious
to bacteria, is used as an indirect means for destroying bacteria
in a practical way. This is done by electrical production
of some substance which is destructive to bacteria as
in ozone water purification (Petrograd, Florence, and elsewhere),
or the use of ultra-violet rays for the same purpose
(Marseilles, Paris) and for treatment of certain disease conditions.
Electricity might be used as a source of heat for
disinfecting purposes should its cheapness justify it. It has
also been used in the preservation of meats to hasten the
<em>penetration of the salt</em> and thus reduce the time of pickling.
Electrolyzed sea water has been tried as a means of flushing
<a id="Page_151"> </a>
<a id="Page_152" class="pagenum" title="152"> </a>
and disinfecting streets, but it is very doubtful if the added
expense is justified by any increased benefit. A number of
electric devices have been put forth for various sterilizing
and disinfecting purposes and doubtless will continue to be,
but everyone should be carefully tested before money is
invested in it.<a id="Marker_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="marker" title="Footnote 19">19</a></p>

<p><b>7. Filtration.</b>&mdash;Filtration is a process for rendering fluids
sterile by passing them through some material which will
<a id="Page_153" class="pagenum" title="153"> </a>
hold back the bacteria. It is used on a large scale in the
purification of water for sanitary or manufacturing reasons
(<a href="#fig-103" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;103</a>). Air is also rendered “germ free” in some surgical
operating rooms, “serum laboratories” and breweries by
filtration. In the laboratory it is a very common method of
sterilizing liquids which would be injured by any other
process. The apparatus consists of a porous cylinder with
proper devices for causing the liquid to pass through either
by suction (<a href="#fig-104" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;104</a>) where the pressure will be only one
atmosphere (approximately 15 pounds per square inch),
or by the use of compressed air at any desired pressure (<a href="#fig-105" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;105</a>).
The two main types of porous cylinders (“filter
<a id="Page_154" class="pagenum" title="154"> </a>
candles,” “bougies”) are the Pasteur-Chamberland (<a href="#fig-106" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;106</a>)
and the Berkefeld. The former are made of unglazed
porcelain of different degrees of fineness, the latter of diatomaceous
earth (<a href="#fig-107" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;107</a>) The Mandler filter of this same
material is now manufactured in the United States and is
equal if not superior to the Berkefeld. The designs of complete
apparatus are numerous.</p>

</div>

<p><b>8. Burying.</b>&mdash;This is a time-honored method of disposing
of infected material of all kinds and at first thought might
not be considered a means of <i>disinfection</i>. As a matter of
fact, under favorable conditions it is an excellent method.
The infected material is removed. Pathogenic organisms
tend to die out in the soil owing to an unfavorable environment
as to temperature and food supply, competition with
natural soil organisms for what food there is, and the injurious
effects of the products of these organisms. Care must
be taken that the burial is done in such a way that the <em>surface</em>
<a id="Page_155" class="pagenum" title="155"> </a>
soil is not contaminated either directly or by material
brought up from below by digging or burrowing animals,
insects, worms, or movement of ground water to the surface.
Also that the underground water supply which is
drawn upon for use by men or animals is not contaminated.
Frequently infected material, carcasses of animals, etc., are
treated in some way so as to aid the natural process of
destruction of the organisms present, especially by the use
of certain chemical agents, as quicklime (see <a href="#Page_158" class="int-ref">p.&nbsp;158</a>).</p>

DISINFECTION AND STERILIZATION (<span class="smcap">Continued</span>).</h3>


<h4 id="CHEMICAL_AGENTS">CHEMICAL AGENTS.</h4>

<p>A very large number of chemical substances might be
used for destroying bacteria or preventing their growth
either through direct injurious action or by the effect of
concentration. Those which are practically useful are relatively
few, though this is one of the commonest methods of
disinfecting and the word “disinfectant” is frequently
wrongly restricted to chemical agents.</p>

<p>Chemical agents act on bacteria in a variety of ways.
Most commonly there is direct union of the chemical with
the protoplasm of the cell and consequent injury. Some
times the chemical is first precipitated on the surface of the
cell without penetrating at once. If removed soon enough,
the organism is not destroyed. This is true of bichloride of
mercury and formaldehyde. If bacteria treated with these
agents in injurious strength be washed with ammonia or
ammonium sulphate, even after a time which would otherwise
result in their failure to grow, they will develop. Some
chemicals change the reaction of the material in a direction
unfavorable to growth, and if the change is enough, may
even kill the bacteria. Some agents remove a chemical
substance necessary to the growth of the organism and
hence inhibit it. Such actions are mainly preventive (antiseptic)
and become disinfectant only after a long time.</p>


<h4 id="ELEMENTS">ELEMENTS.</h4>

<p><b>Oxygen.</b>&mdash;Oxygen as it occurs in the air is probably not
injurious to living bacteria but aids them with the exception
of the anaërobes. In the nascent state especially as
<a id="Page_157" class="pagenum" title="157"> </a>
liberated from ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and
hypochlorites (Ca(ClO)<sub>2</sub>) it is strongly bactericidal.</p>

<p><b>Chlorine.</b>&mdash;Chlorine is actively disinfectant and is coming
into use for sterilizing water on a large scale in municipal
plants (<a href="#fig-108" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;108</a>).</p>

nickel, zinc and copper are markedly germicidal in the
elemental state but are not practical.</p>
<a id="Page_158" class="pagenum" title="158"> </a>


<h4 id="COMPOUNDS">COMPOUNDS.</h4>

<p><b>Calcium Oxide.</b>&mdash;Calcium oxide (CaO), <i>quick lime</i>, is an
excellent disinfectant for stables, yards, outhouses, etc.,
where it is used in the freshly slaked condition as “white
wash;” also to disinfect carcasses to be buried. It is very
efficient against the typhoid bacillus in water, where it is
much used to assist in the softening.</p>

<p><b>Chloride of Lime.</b>&mdash;Chloride of lime, <i class="term">bleaching powder</i>,
which consists of calcium hypochlorite, the active agent,
and chloride and some unchanged quicklime is one of the
most useful disinfectants. It is employed to sterilize water
for drinking purposes on a large scale and to disinfect sewage
plant effluents. A 5 per cent. solution is the proper strength
for ordinary disinfection. Only a supply which is fresh or
has been kept in air-tight containers should be used, as it
rapidly loses strength on exposure to the air. The active
agent is nascent oxygen liberated from the decomposition of
the hypochlorite.</p>

<p><b>Sodium Hypochlorite.</b>&mdash;Sodium hypochlorite prepared by
the electrolysis of common salt has been used to some extent.</p>

<p><b>Bichloride of Mercury.</b>&mdash;Bichloride of mercury, <i>mercuric
chloride, corrosive sublimate</i> (HgCl<sub>2</sub>), is the strongest of all
disinfectants under proper conditions. It is also extremely
poisonous to men and animals and great care is necessary
in its use. It is precipitated by albuminous substances and
attacks metallic objects, hence should not be used in the
presence of these classes of substances.</p>

<p>It is used in a strength of one part HgCl<sub>2</sub> to 1000 of water
for general disinfection. Ammonium chloride or sodium
chloride, common salt, in quantities equal to the bichloride,
or citric acid in one-half of the amount should be added in
making large quantities of solution or for use with albuminous
fluids to prevent precipitation of the mercury (<a href="#fig-109" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;109</a>).</p>

<p>None of the other metallic salts are of value as practical
disinfectants aside from their use in surgical practice. In
this latter class come boric acid, silver nitrate, potassium
permanganate. The strong mineral acids and alkalies are,
of course, destructive to bacteria, but their corrosive effect
<a id="Page_159" class="pagenum" title="159"> </a>
excludes them from practical use, except that “lye washes”
are of value in cleaning floors and rough wood-work, but
even here better <i>disinfection</i> can be done more easily and
safely.</p>

<h4 id="ORGANIC_COMPOUNDS">ORGANIC COMPOUNDS.</h4>

<p><b>Carbolic Acid or Phenol.</b>&mdash;Carbolic acid or phenol (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>
OH) is one of the commonest agents in this class. It is used
mostly in 5 per cent. solution as a disinfectant and in 0.5
per cent. solution as an antiseptic. For use in large quantities
the crude is much cheaper and, according to some experimenters,
even more active than the pure acid, owing to the
cresols it contains. The crude acid is commonly mixed with
an equal volume of commercial sulphuric acid and the mixture
is added to enough water to make a 5 per cent. dilution,
which is stronger than either of the ingredients alone in 5
per cent. solution.</p>

<p><b>Cresols.</b>&mdash;The cresols (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>OH, ortho, meta and
para), coal-tar derivatives, as phenol, are apparently more
powerful disinfectants. A great number of preparations
<a id="Page_160" class="pagenum" title="160"> </a>
containing them have been put on the market. <i class="term">Creolin</i> is
one which is very much used in veterinary practice and
forms a milky fluid with water, while <i class="term">lysol</i> forms a clear
frothy liquid owing to the presence of soap. Both of these
appear to be more active than carbolic acid and are less
poisonous and more agreeable to use. They are used in 2
to 5 per cent. solution.</p>

<p><b>Alcohol.</b>&mdash;Ordinary (ethyl) alcohol (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH) is largely
used as a <i class="term">preservative</i>, also as a disinfectant for the body
surface, hands, and arms. Experiments show that alcohol
of 70 per cent. strength is most strongly bactericidal and
that absolute alcohol is very slightly so.</p>

<p><b>Soap.</b>&mdash;Experimenters have obtained many conflicting
results with soaps when tested on different organisms, as
is to be expected from the great variations in this article.
Miss Vera McCoy in the author’s laboratory carried out
experiments with nine commercial soaps&mdash;Ivory, Naphtha,
Packer’s Tar, Grandpa’s Tar, Balsam Peru, A.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;S. Carbolic,
German Green, Dutch Cleanser, Sapolio&mdash;and obtained
abundant growth from spores of <i class="taxonomy">Bacillus anthracis</i>, from
<i class="taxonomy">Bacterium coli</i> and from <i class="taxonomy">Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus</i> in
all cases even when the organisms had been exposed twenty-four
hours in 5 per cent. solutions. From these results and
from the wide variations reported in the literature it is clear
that <em>soap solutions alone cannot be depended on</em> as disinfectants.
Medicated soaps do not appear to offer any advantages
in this respect. The amount of the disinfectant which
goes into solution when the soap is dissolved is too small to
have any effect.</p>

<p><b>Formaldehyde.</b>&mdash;Formaldehyde (HCHO) is perhaps the
most largely used chemical disinfectant at the present time.
The substance is a gas but occurs most commonly in commerce
as a watery solution containing approximately 40
per cent. of the gas. This solution is variously known as
formalin, formol, and formaldehyde solution. The first two
names are patented and the substance under these names
usually costs more. It is used in the gaseous form for disinfecting
closed spaces of all kinds to the exclusion of most
other means today. A great many types of formalin generators
<a id="Page_161" class="pagenum" title="161"> </a>
have been devised. The gas has little power of
penetration and all material to be reached should be exposed
as much as possible. The dry gas is almost ineffective, so
that the objects must be moistened or vapor generated
along with the gas. A common method in use is to avoid
expensive generators by pouring the formaldehyde solution
on permanganate of potash crystals placed in a vessel
removed from inflammable objects on account of the heat
developed which occasionally sets the gas on fire. The
formalin is used in amounts varying from 20 to 32 ounces
to 8½ to 13 ounces of permanganate to each 1000 cubic feet
of space. This method is expensive since one pint (16
ounces) of formalin is sufficient for each 1000 cubic feet, and
since the permanganate is an added expense. Dr. Dixon,
Commissioner of Health of Pennsylvania, recommends the
following mixture to replace the permanganate, claiming
that it works more rapidly and is less expensive and just
as efficient:</p>

<ol class="list">
<li>1. Sodium bichromate, ten ounces.</li>
<li>2. Saturated solution of formaldehyde, sixteen ounces.</li>
<li>3. Common sulphuric acid, one and a half ounces.</li>
</ol>

<p>Two and three are mixed together and when cool are
poured on the bichromate which is placed in an earthenware
jar of a volume about ten times the quantity of fluid
used. The quantities given are for each 1000 cubic feet of
space.</p>

<p>A very simple method is to cause the formalin, diluted
about twice with water to furnish moisture enough, to drop
by means of a regulated “separator funnel” on a heated
iron plate. The dropping should be so regulated that each
drop is vaporized as it falls. The plate must have raised
edges, pan-shaped, to prevent the drops rolling off when they
first strike the plate. Formaldehyde has no corrosive (except
on iron) or bleaching action, and is the most nearly ideal
closed space disinfectant today. In disinfecting stations it
is made use of in closed sterilizers such as were described
under steam disinfection particularly in connection with
vacuum apparatus. It is also used in solution as a preservative
and as a disinfectant. The commonest strength is
<a id="Page_162" class="pagenum" title="162"> </a>
2 or 3 per cent. of formalin or 0.8 to 1.2 per cent. of the
formaldehyde gas. As an <i class="term">antiseptic</i> it is efficient in dilutions
as high as 1 to 2000 of the gas. It is very irritant to
mucous membranes of most individuals.</p>

<p><b>Anilin Dyes.</b>&mdash;Some of the anilin dyes show remarkable
selective disinfectant and antiseptic action on certain kinds
of bacteria with little effect on others. This has been well
shown by Churchman in his work on Gentian Violet. This
dye inhibits the growth of <i class="term">Gram positive</i> organisms up to a
dilution of one part in 300,000 while for <i class="term">Gram negative</i> organisms
it is without effect even in saturated solution.
This is nicely shown in the accompanying illustration.
This inhibiting effect of anilin dyes is taken advantage of in
several methods of isolating bacteria (<a href="#CHAPTER_XVIII" class="int-ref">Chapter XVIII</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig-110">
<img src="images/fig-110.jpg" width="300" height="300" alt="" /><br />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;110.</span>&mdash;The lower half of the plate is plain agar medium, the upper
half the same medium plus gentian violet to make one part in 300,000. The
Gram positive organism is on the right and the Gram negative on the left.
Streak inoculations were made across both media.</div>
</div>

<p>In addition to the above-discussed disinfectants a large
number of substances, particularly organic, are used in
medicine, surgery, dentistry, etc., as more or less strong
antiseptics, and the list is a constantly lengthening one.</p>

<p>In the laboratory chloroform, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, ether and other volatile
or easily decomposable substances have been used to
sterilize liquids which could not be treated by heat or by
filtration. The agent is removed either by slow evaporation
<a id="Page_163" class="pagenum" title="163"> </a>
or by exhausting the fluid with an air pump. The
method is not very satisfactory, nor is absolute sterilization
easily accomplished. It is much better to secure such
liquids aseptically where possible.</p>

DISINFECTION AND STERILIZATION (<span class="smcap">Continued</span>).</h3>


<h4 id="CHOICE_OF_AGENT">CHOICE OF AGENT.</h4>

<p>The choice of the above-described agents depends on the
conditions. Evidently a barn is not to be disinfected in the
same way that a test-tube in the laboratory is sterilized.
Among the factors to be considered in making a choice are
the thing to be disinfected or sterilized, its size and nature,
that is, whether it will be injured by the process proposed,
cost of the agent, especially<!--TN: was 'expecially'--> when a large amount of material
is to be treated. Among the conditions which affect the
action of all agents the following should be borne in mind
particularly when testing the disinfecting power of chemical
agents:</p>

<p>1. <em>The kind of bacterium</em> to be destroyed, since some are
more readily killed by a given disinfectant than others, even
though no spores are present.</p>

<p>2. <em>The age of the culture.</em> Young bacteria less than twenty-four
hours old are usually more readily killed than older
ones since the cell wall is more delicate and more easily
penetrated, though old growths may be weakened by the
accumulation of their products and be more easily destroyed.</p>

<p>3. <em>Presence of spores</em>, since they are much more resistant
than the growing cells.</p>

<p>4. Whether the organism is a <em>“good” or “bad” growth</em>, <i>i.e.</i>,
whether it has grown in a favorable environment and hence
is vigorous, or under unfavorable conditions and hence is
weak.</p>

<p>5. <em>The number of bacteria present</em>, since with chemical
agents the action is one of relative masses.</p>

<p>6. <em>Nature of the substance in which the bacteria are.</em> Metallic
salts, especially bichloride of mercury, are precipitated
<a id="Page_165" class="pagenum" title="165"> </a>
by albuminous substances and if employed at all must
be used in several times the ordinary strength. Solids
require relatively more of a given solution than liquids.</p>

<p>7. <em>State of the disinfectant</em>, whether solid, liquid or gas,
and whether it is ionized or not. Solutions penetrate best
and are therefore more quickly active and more efficient.</p>

<p>8. <em>The solvent.</em> Water is the best solvent to use. Strong
alcohol (90 per cent. +) diminishes the effect of carbolic
acid, formaldehyde and bichloride of mercury. Oil has a
similar effect. The action is probably to prevent the penetration
of the disinfectant.</p>

<p>9. <em>Strength of solution.</em> The stronger the solution, the
more rapid and more certain the action, for the same reason
as mentioned under 5. In fact, every disinfectant has a
strength below the lethal at which it stimulates bacterial
growth.</p>

<p>10. <em>Addition of salts.</em> Common salt favors the action of
bichloride of mercury and also of carbolic acid. Other salts
may hinder by precipitating the disinfectant.</p>

<p>11. <em>Temperature.</em> Chemical disinfectants, as a rule, follow
the general law that chemical action increases with the
temperature, up to the point where the heat of itself is
sufficient to kill.</p>

<p>12. <em>Time of action.</em> It is scarcely necessary to point out
that a certain length of time is necessary for any disinfectant
to act. One may touch a red hot stove and not be
burned. All the above-mentioned conditions are influenced
by the time of action.</p>


<h4 id="STANDARDIZATION_OF_DISINFECTANTS">STANDARDIZATION OF DISINFECTANTS&mdash;“PHENOL
COEFFICIENT.”</h4>

<p>Many attempts have been made to devise standard
methods for testing the relative strengths of disinfectants.
The one most widely used in the United States is the so-called
“Hygienic Laboratory” method of determining the
“phenol coefficient” of the given substance and is a modification
of the method originally proposed by Rideal and
Walker in England. In this method as proposed by Anderson
<a id="Page_166" class="pagenum" title="166"> </a>
and McClintic, formerly of the above laboratory, the
strengths of the dilution of the disinfectant to be tested
which kills a culture of <i class="taxonomy">Bacterium typhosum</i> in 2½ minutes
is divided by the strength of the dilution of carbolic acid
which does the same; and the dilution which kills in 15
minutes is likewise divided by the corresponding dilution
of carbolic acid. The two ratios thus obtained are averaged
and the result is the “phenol coefficient.” For example</p>

<p class="continued">Standard conditions of temperature, age of culture, medium,
reaction, etc., and of making the dilutions and transfers are
insisted on. Details may be found in the Journal of Infectious
Diseases, 1911, 8, p.&nbsp;1.</p>

<p>This is probably as good a method as any for arriving at
the relative strengths of disinfectants and in the hands of
any given worker concordant results in comparative tests
can usually be attained. Experience has shown that the
results obtained by different workers with the same disinfectant
may be decidedly at variance. This is to be expected
from a knowledge of the factors affecting the action of
disinfectants above stated and from the known specific
action of certain disinfectants on certain organisms (compare
anilin dyes, <a href="#Page_162" class="int-ref">p.&nbsp;162</a>).</p>

<p>It seems that the only sure way to test the action of such
a substance is to try it out in the way it is to be used. It is
scarcely wise to adopt the “phenol coefficient” method as a
legal standard method as some states have done.</p>


<h4 id="PRACTICAL_STERILIZATION_AND_DISINFECTION">PRACTICAL STERILIZATION AND DISINFECTION.</h4>

<p>The methods for sterilizing in the laboratory have been
discussed and will be referred to again in the next chapter.</p>

<p><a id="Page_167" class="pagenum" title="167"> </a>
In practical disinfection it is a good plan always to <em>proceed
as though spores were present</em> even if the organism is
known. Hence use an <em>abundance of the agent</em> and <em>apply it
as long as practicable</em>. Also it is best to secure the <em>chemical
substances used as such</em> and <em>not depend on patented mixtures
purporting to contain them</em>. As a rule the latter are <em>more
expensive</em> in <em>proportion to the results secured</em>.</p>

<p><i>Surgical instruments</i> may be sterilized by boiling in water
for fifteen minutes, provided they are clean, as they should
be. If dried blood, pus, mucus, etc., are adherent, which
should never be the case, they should be boiled one-half
hour. The addition of sodium carbonate (0.5 to 1 per cent.)
prevents rusting. Surgeons’ sterilizers are to be had at
reasonable prices and are very convenient. Whether the
instruments are boiled or subjected to streaming steam
depends on whether the supporting tray is covered with
water or not. The author finds it a good plan to keep the
needles of hypodermic syringes in a small wire basket in
an <i>oil bath</i>. The oil may be heated to 150° to 200° and the
needles sterilized in a very few minutes. The oil also prevents
rusting.</p>

<p><i>Rooms</i>, <i>offices</i> and all spaces which may be readily made
practically gas-tight are best disinfected by means of formaldehyde
by any of the methods above described (<a href="#fig-111" class="int-ref">Figs.&nbsp;111</a>
and <a href="#fig-112" class="int-ref">112</a>).</p>

<p><i>Stables</i> and <i>Barnyards</i> (Mohler): “A preliminary cleaning
up of all litter is advisable together with the scraping of the
floor, mangers and walls of the stable with hoes and the
removal of all dust and filth. All this material should be
burned since it probably contains the infective agent. Heat
may be applied to the surfaces, including barnyard, by means
of a ‘cyclone oil burner.’ When such burning is impracticable,
the walls may be disinfected with one of the following:</p>

<ol class="list">
  <li>1. Whitewash 1 gallon + chloride of lime 6 ounces.</li>

  <li>2. Whitewash 1 gallon + crude carbolic acid 7 ounces.</li>

  <li>3. Whitewash 1 gallon + formalin 4 ounces.</li>
</ol>

<p>The same may be applied with brushes or, more rapidly,
sprayed on with a pump; the surface soil of the yard and
surroundings should be removed to a depth of 5 or 6 inches,
<a id="Page_168" class="pagenum" title="168"> </a>
placed in a heap and thoroughly mixed with quicklime.

thereupon pushed into the fluid, when a lively reaction follows.
Owing to the heat generated, it is advisable to place
the chloride of lime in an iron crucible (pot), and to have
nothing inflammable within a radius of two feet. The number
and location of these cones of chloride of lime depend
on the size and structure of the building to be disinfected.

the above sized cone will be sufficient for disinfecting 5200

THE STUDY OF BACTERIA.</h2>

<hr />


<h3 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br />

CULTURE MEDIA.</h3>


<p>The study of bacteria may be taken up for the disciplinary
and pedagogic value of the study of a science; with
the idea of extending the limits of knowledge; or for the
purpose of learning their beneficial or injurious actions with
the object of taking advantage of the former and combating
or preventing the latter.</p>

<p>Since bacteria are classed as plants, their successful study
implies their cultivation on a suitable soil. A growth of
bacteria is called a “<i class="term">culture</i>” and the “soil” or material
on which they are grown is called a “<i class="term">culture medium</i>.”
In so far as the culture medium is made up in the laboratory
it is an “artificial culture medium” as distinguished from a
natural medium. A culture consisting of one kind of bacteria
only is spoken of as a “pure culture,” and accurate
knowledge of bacteria depends on obtaining them in “pure
culture.” After getting a “pure culture” the special characteristics
of the organism must be ascertained in order to distinguish
it from others. The discussion of the <i class="term">morphology</i>
of bacteria in <a href="#CHAPTER_II" class="int-ref">Chapters II</a>, <a href="#CHAPTER_III" class="int-ref">III</a>, and <a href="#CHAPTER_IV" class="int-ref">IV</a> shows that the
morphological structures are too few to separate individual
kinds. They serve at best to enable groups of similarly
appearing forms to be arranged. Hence any further differentiation
must be based on a study of the <i class="term">physiology</i> of the
<a id="Page_172" class="pagenum" title="172"> </a>
organism as discussed in the chapters on <a href="#PART_II" class="int-ref">Physiological
Activities of Bacteria</a>.</p>

<p>The thorough study of a bacterium involves, therefore:</p>

<p>1. Its isolation in pure culture.</p>

<p>2. Its study with the microscope to determine morphological
features and staining reactions.</p>

<p>3. Growth on culture media for determining its physiological
activities as well as morphological characteristics of
the growths themselves.</p>

<p>4. Animal inoculations in certain instances.</p>

<p>5. Special serum reactions in some cases.</p>

<p>Since isolation in pure culture requires material for growing
the organism, the first subject to be considered is
culture media.</p>

<p>A culture medium for a given bacterium should show the
following essentials:</p>

<p>1. It must contain all the elements necessary for the
growth of the organism except those that may be obtained
from the surrounding atmosphere.</p>

<p>2. These elements must be in a form available to the
organism.</p>

<p>3. The medium must not be too dry, in order to furnish
sufficient moisture for growth and to prevent too great a
concentration of the different ingredients.</p>

<p>4. The reaction must be adjusted to suit the particular
organism dealt with.</p>

<p>5. There must be no injurious substances present in
concentration sufficient to inhibit the growth of the organism
or to kill it.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, more attention must be paid to the sources of
the two elements N and C than to the others, for in general
the substances used to furnish these two and the water
contain the other elements in sufficient amount. For very
exact work on the products of bacteria, <i class="term">synthetic media</i>
containing definite amounts of chemicals of known composition
have been prepared, but for most of the work with
bacteria pathogenic to animals such media are not needed.</p>

<p>Culture media may be either <i>liquid</i> or <i>solid</i>, or for certain
purposes may be liquid at higher temperatures and solid at
<a id="Page_173" class="pagenum" title="173"> </a>
lower, as indicated later. Liquid media are of value for
obtaining bacteria for the study of morphology and cell
groupings and for ascertaining many of the physiological
activities of the organisms. Solid media are useful for
studying some few of the physiological activities and especially
for determining characteristic appearances of the
isolated growths of bacteria. These isolated growths of
bacteria on solid media are technically spoken of as “<i class="term">colonies</i>,”
whether they are microscopic in size or visible to the
unaided eye.</p>

<p>It is clear that the kinds of culture media used for the
study of bacteria may be unlimited but the undergraduate
student will need to use a relatively small number, which
will be discussed in this section.</p>

<p><b>Meat Broth (Bouillon).</b><a id="Marker_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="marker" title="Footnote 20">20</a>&mdash;This itself is used as a medium
and as the basis for the preparation of other solid and liquid
media.</p>

<p>Finely ground <em>lean</em> beef is selected because it contains the
necessary food materials. Fat is not desired since it is a
poor food for most bacteria and in the further processes of
preparation would be melted and form an undesirable film
on the surface of the medium. The meat is placed in a
suitable container and mixed with about twice its weight of
<em>cold</em> water (not distilled) and allowed to soak overnight or
longer. The cold water extracts from the meat water-soluble
proteins, blood, carbohydrates in the form of dextrose
(occasionally some glycogen), nitrogenous extractives
and some of the mineral salts. The fluid is strained or
pressed free from the meat. This “meat juice” should now
be thoroughly boiled, which results in a coagulation of a
large part of the proteins and a precipitation of some of the
mineral salts, particularly phosphates of calcium and magnesium,
both of which must be filtered off and the water
loss restored by adding the proper amount of distilled water.
The boiling is done at this point because the medium must
later be heated to sterilize it and it is best to get rid of the
<a id="Page_174" class="pagenum" title="174"> </a>
coagulable proteins at once. The proteins thus thrown out
deprive the medium of valuable nitrogenous food material
which is replaced by adding about 1 per cent. by weight of
commercial peptone. It is usual also (though not always
necessary) to add about 0.5 per cent. by weight of common
salt which helps to restore the proper concentration of mineral
ingredients lost by the boiling. The chlorine is also
an essential element. The reaction is now determined and
adjusted to the desired end point, “standardized,” as it is
called. The medium is again <em>thoroughly</em> boiled and filtered
boiling hot. The adjusting of the reaction and the boiling
ordinarily cause a precipitate to form which is largely phosphates
of the alkaline earths with some protein. The
filtered medium is collected in suitable containers, flasks or
tubes, which are plugged with well-fitting non-absorbent
cotton plugs and sterilized, best in the autoclave for twenty
minutes at 15 pounds pressure, or discontinuously in streaming
steam at 100°. If careful attention is paid to <em>titration</em>
and to <em>sufficient boiling</em> where indicated, the meat broth
prepared as above should be clear, only faintly yellowish in
color and show no precipitate on cooling.</p>

<p>The conventional method for standardizing an acid medium
is as follows: Take 5 cc of the medium, add 45 cc of
distilled water and 1 cc of <i>phenolphthalein</i> as indicator.
Boil the solution and while still hot run in from a burette
N/20 NaOH solution until a faint pink color appears.
From the number of cc of N/20 NaOH used to “neutralize”
the 5 cc of medium it is calculated how many cc of
N/1 NaOH are necessary to give the desired end reaction
to the volume of medium which is to be standardized. The
resulting reaction is expressed as % <i>acid or alkaline to phenolphthalein</i>.
If it is necessary to add to each 100 cc of the
medium 1 cc of N/1 NaOH to make it neutral to phenolphthalein,
the reaction is called 1% acid: if to each 100 cc
of medium there is added 1 cc of N/1 alkali in addition to
the quantity necessary to neutralize, the reaction is called
1% alkaline.</p>

<p>In order to obtain a pink color when titrating with this
indicator not only must the “free acid” be neutralized by
<a id="Page_175" class="pagenum" title="175"> </a>
the alkali but also loosely combined acid and any other
substances present which will combine with the alkali rather
than with the indicator so that in many media <em>more alkali</em>
is added than is necessary to neutralize the “free acid,”
<i>i.e.</i>, the free H ions present.</p>

<p>It is well established that the controlling factor in the
growth of bacteria in so far as “reaction” is concerned is
not the <i>titratable substances</i> present but only the “free acid,”
<i>i.e.</i>, the <i>number of free H ions</i>, consequently it is better to
determine the concentration of H ions and to <em>standardize
to a definite H ion concentration</em>. Phenolphthalein as shown
above is not a good indicator for this purpose.</p>

<p>The H ions present can be determined accurately in all
cases only by electrolytic methods. The apparatus necessary
is usually relatively expensive and scarcely adapted to
the use of large classes of students. There are a number of
indicators each of which will show color changes within
rather narrow ranges of H ion concentration. Standardization
by the use of these indicators, the “colorimetric
method,” is recommended by the Society of American
Bacteriologists and is coming into general use.</p>

<p>The H ion concentration is ordinarily <em>indicated</em> by the
conventional symbol P<sub>H</sub>, <i>e.g.</i>, the concentration in pure
water which is regarded as neutral is expressed as P<sub>H</sub> 7; of
normal HCl, P<sub>H</sub> 0; of normal NaOH, P<sub>H</sub> 14. The
figure after P<sub>H</sub> does not in reality represent the concentration
of H ions in the solution. This, like the concentration
of acids, is expressed on the basis of normality, <i>i.e.</i>, as
compared with the concentration of a normal solution
(1 g. equivalent) of H ions. Concentration of H ions in pure
water is N/10,000,000, <i>i.e.</i>, is 1/10,000,000 of the concentration
in a normal solution of H ions. Expressed in
other words, it is the concentration in a normal solution of
H ions diluted ten million times. 10,000,000&nbsp;=&nbsp;10 to the
7th power&nbsp;=&nbsp;10<sup>7</sup>. Hence the figure after the P<sub>H</sub> indicates
the <em>logarithm of the number of times the solution is diluted</em>.
Therefore this number <em>increases with the dilution</em>, and the
larger the figure after the P<sub>H</sub>, the <em>less acid the solution is</em>.</p>

<p><a id="Page_176" class="pagenum" title="176"> </a>
Most saprophytic organisms and many parasitic ones
grow within a wide range of H ion concentration so that
titration with phenolphthalein gives sufficient accuracy for
media for such organisms. On the other hand, many
organisms grow within a very narrow range of H ion concentration,
hence accurate standardization to a definite
H ion concentration is necessary. It is also evident that for
comparative work, such standardization is essential because
this reaction can be reproduced in other media and by
other workers.<a id="Marker_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="marker" title="Footnote 21">21</a></p>

<p>Broth may be prepared from Liebig’s or Armour’s meat
extract by adding 5 grams of either, 10 grams peptone and
5 grams NaCl to 1000 cc of water, boiling to dissolve, then
titrating and filtering as above.</p>

<p>The author after much experience finds <i>meat juice</i> preferable
to meat extract for broth and other media for pathogenic
bacteria, and has abandoned the use of meat extracts
for these organisms.</p>

<p><b>Glycerin Broth.</b>&mdash;Glycerin broth is made by adding 4 to
6 per cent. of glycerin to the broth just previous to the
sterilization. The glycerin serves as a source of carbon to
certain bacteria which will not grow on the ordinary broth&mdash;as
<i class="taxonomy">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>.</p>

<p><b>Sugar Broths.</b>&mdash;Sugar broths are used for determining
the action of bacteria on these carbohydrates, since this is a
valuable means of differentiating certain forms, especially
those from the intestinal tract. Broth <em>free from sugar</em> must
first be made. This is done by adding to broth prepared as
already described, <em>just previous to final filtering and sterilization</em>,
a culture of some sugar-destroying organism (<i class="taxonomy">Bacterium
coli</i> is ordinarily used), and then allowing the organism to
grow in the raw broth at body temperature for twenty-four
hours. Any carbohydrate in the broth is destroyed by the
<a id="Page_177" class="pagenum" title="177"> </a>
<i class="taxonomy">Bacterium coli</i>. This mixture is then boiled to kill the <i class="taxonomy">Bacterium
coli</i>, restandardized and then 1 per cent. by weight of
required sugar is added. Dextrose, saccharose and lactose
are the most used, though many others are used for special
purposes. After the sugar is added the medium must be
sterilized by <i>discontinuous heating</i> at 100° for three or four
successive days, because long boiling or heating in the autoclave
splits up the di- and polysaccharids into simpler sugars
and may even convert the simple sugars (dextrose) into acid.</p>

<p>Various other <i>modified broths</i> are frequently used for special
purposes but need not be discussed here.</p>

<p><b>Dunham’s peptone solution</b>, frequently used to determine
indol production, is a solution of 1 per cent. of peptone and
0.5 per cent. of salt in tap water. It does not need to be
titrated, but should be boiled and filtered into tubes or
flasks and sterilized.</p>

<p><b>Nitrate Broth.</b>&mdash;Nitrate broth for determining nitrate
reduction is 1 per cent. of peptone, 0.2 per cent. of C.&nbsp;P.
potassium nitrate dissolved in distilled water and sterilized.</p>

<p><b>Milk.</b>&mdash;Milk is a natural culture medium much used. It
should be fresh and thoroughly skimmed, best by a separator
or centrifuge to get rid of the <i>fat</i>. If the milk is not fresh,
it should be titrated as for broth and the reaction adjusted.
The milk should be sterilized discontinuously to avoid splitting
up the lactose as well as action on the casein and calcium
phosphate.</p>

<p><i>Litmus Milk.</i>&mdash;Litmus milk is milk as above to which
litmus has been added as an acid production indicator. The
milk should show blue when the litmus is added or be made
to by the addition of normal NaOH solution. It should be
sterilized discontinuously. Frequently on heating litmus
milk the blue color disappears due to a reduction of the
litmus. This blue color will reappear on shaking with air
or on standing several days, due to absorption of O and
oxidation of the reduced litmus, provided the heating has
produced no other change in the milk, as proper heating will
not.</p>

<p><b>Gelatin Culture Medium.</b>&mdash;Gelatin to the extent of 10 to
15 per cent. is frequently added to broth and gives a culture
<a id="Page_178" class="pagenum" title="178"> </a>
medium of many advantages. It is solid at temperatures
up to about 25° and fluid above this temperature, a property
which is of great advantage in the isolation of bacteria.
(See <a href="#CHAPTER_XVIII" class="int-ref">Chapter XVIII</a>.) Further gelatin is liquefied (that is
digested, converted into gelatin proteose and gelatin peptone,
which are soluble in water and do not gelatinize) by
many bacteria and not by others, a valuable diagnostic feature.
The gelatin colonies of many bacteria are very characteristic
in appearance, as is the growth of many on gelatin
in culture tubes.</p>

<p>Gelatin medium may be prepared by adding the proper
amount of gelatin (10 to 15 per cent. by weight) broken into
small pieces (powdered gelatin in the same proportion may
be used) to broth, gently warming until the gelatin is dissolved,
standardizing as for broth, filtering and sterilizing. It is
usually cleared before filtering by stirring into the gelatin
solution, cooled to below 60°, the white of an egg for each
1000&nbsp;cc., and then thoroughly boiling before filtering. The
coagulation of the egg albumen entangles the suspended
matter so that the gelatin filters perfectly clear, though
with a slight yellowish color. The filtering may be done
through filter paper if the gelatin is well boiled and filtered
boiling hot, but is more conveniently done through absorbent
cotton, wet with boiling water.</p>

<p>Or, the gelatin may be added to <em>meat juice before it is
boiled</em>, then this is heated to about body temperature (not
too hot, or the proteins will be coagulated too soon) until
the gelatin is dissolved. Then the material is standardized
and thoroughly boiled and filtered. The proteins of the
meat juice coagulate and thus clear the medium without
the addition of egg white. Commercial gelatin is markedly
acid from the method of manufacture, hence the medium
requires careful titration, even when made from a standardized
broth.</p>

<p>Gelatin should be sterilized by discontinuous heating at
100° on three successive days, because long boiling or heating
above 100° tends to hydrolyze the gelatin into gelatin
proteose and peptone and it will not gelatinize on cooling.
It may be heated in the autoclave for ten to fifteen minutes
<a id="Page_179" class="pagenum" title="179"> </a>
at 10 pounds’ pressure and sometimes not be hydrolyzed,
but the procedure is uncertain and very resistant spores may
not be killed. The medium should be put into the culture
tubes in which it is to be used as soon as filtered, and sterilized
in these, since, if put into flasks these must be sterilized<!--TN: was 'steriliized'-->,
and then when transferred to tubes for use, it must be
again sterilized unless great care is taken to have the tubes
plugged and sterilized first, and in transferring aseptically
to these tubes. These repeated heatings are very apt to
decompose the gelatin, so it will not “set” on cooling. The
prepared and sterilized tubes of gelatin should be kept in
an ice-box or cool room, as they will melt in overheated
laboratories in summer or winter.</p>

<p><b>Agar Medium.</b>&mdash;Agar agar, usually called agar, is a complex
carbohydrate substance of unknown composition obtained
from certain seaweeds along the coast of Japan
and Southeastern Asia. It occurs in commerce as thin
translucent strips or as a powder. It resembles gelatin
only in the property its solutions have of gelatinizing when
cooled. Gelatin is an albuminoid closely related to the
proteins, agar a carbohydrate. Agar is much less soluble in
water, 1 or 1.5 per cent. of agar giving a jelly as dense as 10
to 15 per cent. of gelatin. It dissolves only in water heated
to near the boiling-point (98° to 99°) and only after much
longer heating. This hot solution “jells,” “sets” or gelatinizes
at about 38° and remains solid until again heated to
near boiling. Hence bacteria may be grown on agar at the
body temperature (37°) and above, and the agar will remain
solid, while gelatin media are fluid above about 25°. No
pathogenic bacteria and none of the saprophytes liable to
be met with in the laboratory are able to “liquefy” agar.</p>

<p>An agar medium is conveniently prepared from broth by
adding 1 or 1.5 per cent. of the finely divided agar to the
broth and boiling until dissolved, standardizing, clearing,
filtering, and sterilizing. The agar must be thoroughly
boiled, usually for ten to fifteen minutes, and the water loss
made up by the addition of distilled water before titration.
Agar is practically neutral so that there is little difference
between the titration of the dissolved agar and the original
<a id="Page_180" class="pagenum" title="180"> </a>
broth. The agar solution should be kept hot from the beginning
to the end except the cooling down to below 60°, when
the egg white for clearing is added. Though filtration
through paper is possible as with gelatin, if the agar solution
is thoroughly boiled and filtered boiling hot, it is more satisfactory
for beginners to use absorbent cotton wet with boiling
water and to pour the hot agar through the same filter
if not clear the first time. The solidified agar medium is
never perfectly clear, but always more or less opalescent.
The agar medium may be sterilized in the autoclave for
fifteen minutes at 15 pounds pressure as the high temperature
does not injure the agar.</p>

<p><b>Potato Media.</b>&mdash;Potatoes furnish a natural culture medium
which is very useful for the study of many bacteria.
The simplest, and for most purposes the best, way to use
potatoes is in culture tubes as “potato tube cultures” (No.
8, <a href="#fig-119" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;119</a>). These are prepared as follows: Large tubes
are used. Large healthy potatoes are selected. Each end
of the potato is sliced off so as to have parallel surfaces.
With a cork-borer of a size to fit the tubes used, cylinders
about one and one-half inches long are made. Each cylinder
is cut diagonally from base to base. This furnishes two
pieces each with a circular base and an oval, sloping surface.
The pieces are then washed clean and dropped for a minute
into boiling water to destroy the oxidizing enzyme on the
surface which would otherwise cause a darkening of the
potato. (The darkening may also be prevented by keeping
the freshly cut potatoes covered with clean water until
ready to sterilize.) A bit of cotton one-fourth to one-half
inch in depth is put into each of the test-tubes to retain
moisture and a piece of potato dropped in, circular base
down. The tubes are then plugged with cotton and sterilized
in the autoclave at 15 pounds pressure for not less
than twenty-five minutes, since potatoes usually harbor
very resistant spores, and it is not unusual for a few tubes
to spoil even after this thorough heating.</p>

<p>Potatoes are sometimes used in “potato plate cultures.”
The term “plate culture” is a relic of the time when flat
glass plates were used for this and other “plate cultures.”
<a id="Page_181" class="pagenum" title="181"> </a>
Now glass dishes of the general form shown in <a href="#fig-115" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;115</a>,
called “Petri dishes,” or plates are used for practically all
plate culture work. For “potato plates” slices from potatoes
are cut as large and as thick as the relative sizes of
potato and dish permit (<a href="#fig-116" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;116</a>). The slices should be
thin enough not to touch the lid and thick enough to be
firm.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.&nbsp;116.</span>&mdash;A potato plate. ×&nbsp;½</div>
</div>

<p>It is a good plan to wrap each dish separately in paper to
retain the lid securely, then sterilize as for potato tubes,
and leave plates wrapped until wanted.</p>

<p><a id="Page_182" class="pagenum" title="182"> </a>
It sometimes happens that the natural acidity of potatoes
is too great for the growth of many organisms. The acidity
is sufficiently corrected by soaking the pieces of potato in a
1 per cent. solution of sodium carbonate for an hour before
they are put into the tubes or plates.</p>

<p><i>Glycerinized potato tubes</i> are conveniently prepared by
covering the potato in the tube with glycerin broth, sterilizing
and pouring off the excess broth immediately after
sterilizing, taking care that the tubes do not become contaminated
which is not very probable if the work is quickly
done while the tubes are still hot.</p>

<p><b>Blood Serum Media.</b>&mdash;Blood serum, usually from the
larger, domestic animals on account of convenience in securing
it in quantity, is used in the study of the bacteria
causing disease in man and animals. Most commonly the
serum is collected from the clotted blood after it has well
separated (usually about forty-eight hours is required for
this). It is then run into tubes which are plugged with
cotton and placed in an apparatus for coagulating the serum
by heat. A copper water bath with a tightly closed air
compartment or the horizontal autoclave (<a href="#fig-81" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;81</a>) is sufficient
for this purpose, though special forms of apparatus are
to be had. It is important that the temperature be raised
slowly so that the blood gases escape gradually. Three to
five hours or longer should be allowed for the temperature
to reach the boiling-point. If the tubes are heated too
rapidly, the serum is filled with bubbles and badly torn
since the gases are driven off suddenly. <i>Löffler’s serum</i> is
made by adding one part of dextrose broth to three parts
of serum and then coagulating as above. The solidified
serum in either case is best sterilized discontinuously,
though with care the autoclave at 15 pounds pressure may
be used for a single sterilization. This is very apt to cause
a greater darkening of the serum and frequently also a
laceration of the solid mass by escaping gases.</p>

<p>Blood serum is also used in the liquid state. For this
purpose it is best to collect it aseptically; or it may be
sterilized discontinuously at a temperature of 55° or 56° on
seven to ten consecutive days. Novy has recently suggested
<a id="Page_183" class="pagenum" title="183"> </a>
dialyzing the serum to free it from salts and thus
prevent its coagulation when heated. Whether the removal
of the various “extractives” which diffuse out with the salts
deprives the serum of any of its advantageous properties
remains to be ascertained.</p>

<p>From the discussion of the physiological activities of bacteria
in <a href="#CHAPTER_IX" class="int-ref">Chapters IX&ndash;XII</a> it is apparent that a very great
variety of culture media other than those described is necessary
for the study of special types of bacteria, but such
media are beyond the scope of the present work.</p>

<p>The ideal culture media are without a doubt the <i>synthetic
media</i>, that is media of definite known chemical composition,
so that the various changes due to the growth of bacteria
can be accurately determined and thus a means of sharply
differentiating closely related organisms be secured. Such
media have been prepared and every bacteriologist believes
strongly in their future usefulness when media of wider
application shall have been devised. An example of this
type of culture media is Uschinsky’s synthetic medium, of
which the following is one of the modifications:</p>

<table class="borders" summary="synthetic medium"><!--TN: repeated text indicated by dittos in original text-->

<p>A criticism of this medium is that the elements K, Ca,
Mg, Fe, Mn, and S which have been shown to be essential
are not present if chemically pure salts are used in the
preparation.</p>

METHODS OF USING CULTURE MEDIA.</h3>


<p>The way in which culture media shall be used depends
on the purpose in view. By far the larger part of bacteriological
work is done with cultures in “bacteriological culture
tubes.” Various laboratories have their own special
types but all are more or less after the “Board of Health”
form. They differ from ordinary chemical test-tubes in that
they are usually longer, have no “lip” and have much thicker
walls to prevent breakage and consequent loss of the culture
as well as danger from pathogenic organisms. The
author finds two sets of tubes most serviceable for student
use&mdash;one size 15&nbsp;cm. long by 19&nbsp;mm. outside diameter
(No.&nbsp;9, <a href="#fig-119" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;119</a>), the other 15&nbsp;cm. long by 13&nbsp;mm. (Nos.
1 to 7, <a href="#fig-119" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;119</a>). Culture tubes are conveniently used in
“wire baskets” circular or square in section and of a size
to correspond with the length and number of tubes used.
These baskets are light, do not break, and if made of good
galvanized wire netting do not readily rust (<a href="#fig-117" class="int-ref">Figs.&nbsp;117</a> and
<a href="#fig-118" class="int-ref">118</a>).</p>

<p>Liquid media such as broth, milk, litmus milk, indol and
nitrate broths are used in the above-mentioned tubes when
small quantities only are to be worked with. The tubes
are filled approximately one-third full, then plugged with
<i>non-absorbent</i> cotton and sterilized. <i>Cotton plugs</i> are used
so much in bacteriological work because they permit a free
circulation of air and gases and at the same time act as
filters to keep out the bacteria of the air.</p>

<p>Sugar broths or other media in which gas may be produced
are used in fermentation tubes (Smith tubes) of the type
shown in <a href="#fig-120" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;120</a> so that the gas may be collected in the
closed arm of the tube, measured (<a href="#fig-121" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;121</a>) and tested if
desired.</p>

<p>One method of using gelatin and also agar is as “puncture”

full of the medium while it is still fluid, plugged, sterilized
and allowed to cool in the vertical position. The medium
is then “inoculated” with a <em>straight</em> platinum needle by
plunging this into the center of the surface down to the
bottom of the tube (<a href="#fig-119" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;119</a>, Nos.&nbsp;4 and 5).</p>

<p>Agar and blood serum are frequently used in the form of
“slope” or “slant” cultures. That is, the medium solidifies
with the tubes lying on their sides which gives a long, sloping

used in the form of “plate cultures” also. For this purpose
Petri dishes are first sterilized, then the melted agar or
gelatin poured into them and allowed to “set” while the
plates are kept horizontal. The melted media may be
“inoculated” before they are poured, or a portion of the
material to be “plated” may be placed in the dish, then the
melted medium poured in and distributed over the dish by
tilting in various directions, or the medium after solidifying
may be inoculated by “strokes” or “streaks” over its
surface, according to the purpose in view in using the plate.
The larger sized tubes should be used for making plates in
order to have sufficient medium in the plate (No.&nbsp;9, <a href="#fig-119" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;119</a>).</p>

<p>For using large quantities of medium, Florence flasks,
Ehrlenmeyer flasks, special toxin flasks (<a href="#fig-122" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;122</a>) or various
other devices (Vaughan and Novy’s “mass cultures,” <a href="#fig-123" class="int-ref">Figs.&nbsp;123</a>
and <a href="#fig-124" class="int-ref">124</a>) have been employed.</p>

<p>For growing <i>anaërobic organisms</i> it is evident that some
method for removing and excluding the oxygen of the air
must be used. A very great variety of appliances have
been devised for these purposes. Some are based on the
principle of the vacuum, exhausting the air with an air
pump; some on replacing the air with a stream of hydrogen;
others on absorbing the oxygen by chemical means, as with
an alkaline solution of pyrogallic acid, or even by growing
a vigorous aërobe in the same culture or in the same container
with the anaërobe, the aërobe exhausting the oxygen
so that the anaërobe then develops, or finally by excluding
the air through the use of deep culture tubes well filled with
the medium, or in the closed arm of fermentation tubes.
For many purposes a combination of two or more of the
above methods gives good results.</p>

<p>In any event the culture medium should have been <em>freshly
sterilized</em> just before use, or <em>should be boiled</em> in order to drive
out the dissolved oxygen. For most, anaërobes the presence
in the medium of about 1 per cent. of a carbohydrate, as
dextrose, is advisable.</p>

<p>A description of all the various devices is unnecessary in
this work, but the following have answered most of the

which has been previously inoculated with the anaërobic

the tip, as far as the constriction. The tube is then sealed
in the flame at the small end and also at the constriction.
Since it is full of the medium and sealed, access of air is
prevented. This forms an excellent means for “isolation”
(<a href="#CHAPTER_XVIII" class="int-ref">Chapter XVIII</a>); the tube needs merely to be cut with a
file at the point where colonies appear, then these may be
readily transferred.</p>

liquid cultures of anaërobes, the growth occurring in the
closed arm only, while with facultative anaërobes, growth
occurs both in the closed arm and in the open bulb. A little
“paraffin oil” (a clear, heavy petroleum derivative) may be
poured on the fluid in the open bulb as a very efficient
seal, though it is not usually necessary.</p>

<p><i>D.</i> For slope or plate, or any type of surface cultures the
Novy jar (<a href="#fig-127" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;127</a>) is the most practical device. It is good
practice to combine the vacuum method, the hydrogen
replacement method and the oxygen absorption method in
using these jars. In operation a solution of 20 per cent.
NaOH is poured on the bottom of the jar to a depth of 1
or 2&nbsp;cm., the cultures are placed on glass supports above
the alkali and a short wide tube of strong pyrogallol is set
in on the bottom in such a way that it may be easily upset
<a id="Page_192" class="pagenum" title="192"> </a>
and mixed with the alkali when it is desired to do so. The
cover is now clamped in position with all joints well vaselined.
Then the outlet tube is connected with a suction
pump and the air drawn out. Meanwhile the inlet tube
has been connected with a hydrogen generator, and after
the jar is exhausted hydrogen is allowed to flow in, and this
process is repeated until one is satisfied that the air is replaced.
The suction exhausts the air from the tubes or
plates so that much less time is required to replace the
air with hydrogen. Finally the stop-cock is closed, and the
pyrogallol solution is gently shaken down and mixed with
the alkali so that any remaining oxygen will be absorbed.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that facultative anaërobes as well
as anaërobes will grow under any of the above conditions,
so that cultures of organisms so obtained must be further
tested aërobically in order to determine to which group
the organisms belong.</p>

<p>Reference has been made above to the “inoculation” of
culture media, which means introducing into the medium
used the desired material in the proper way. For small
quantities this is most conveniently done with platinum
“needles,” that is, pieces of platinum wire inserted into the
ends of glass rods. The “straight” needle is a piece of
heavy platinum wire of about 0.022 inch in diameter (<a href="#fig-128" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;128</a>).
It is used most frequently to inoculate all forms of
<a id="Page_193" class="pagenum" title="193"> </a>
<i class="term">solid media</i>. The platinum loop is of lighter wire, 0.018 inch.
The loop in the end is conveniently made by twisting the
wire around the lead of an ordinary lead-pencil. The “loop
needle” (<a href="#fig-129" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;129</a>) is most used in transferring liquid media.
On account of the high price of platinum, the author has
substituted “nichrome” wire for student use. This is
stiffer, not so easily made into loops and breaks out of the
rods more easily. The latter defect is remedied to some
extent, by imbedding the wire only slightly for about one-fourth
of an inch on the side of the end portion of the rod.
The low cost, less than one-twentieth of platinum<!--TN: was 'platimum'-->, justifies
its use.</p>

ISOLATION OF BACTERIA IN PURE CULTURE.</h3>


<p>As has been stated, the thorough study of a bacterium
depends on first getting it in pure culture. In the early
days of bacteriology supposedly pure cultures were obtained
by (1) <em>dilution in liquid media</em>. A series of tubes or flasks
containing sterile liquid media was prepared. Number one
was inoculated with the material to be examined and thoroughly
mixed. A small portion of the mixture was transferred
to number two, and mixed; from this to number
three, and so on until a sufficient number were inoculated,
the last three or four in the series receiving the same amounts
of a very high dilution of the original material. If one or
two of these latter showed a growth and the others not, it
was assumed that the dilution had been carried so far that
only a single organism was transferred and therefore the
culture obtained was “pure.” The method in this crude
form is too uncertain to be of value today and recourse is
had to more exact means. The procedure most widely used
is that of (2) “<i>plating out</i>” by means of gelatin or agar
plates. The material to be plated out is diluted by transferring
to three or more tubes of melted gelatin or agar as
in the first method and then all the tubes are poured into
Petri dishes and grown under suitable conditions. By
proper mixing in the tubes the bacteria are well scattered
through the medium which holds the individual organisms
separate when it solidifies. On some of the plates a sufficient
dilution will be reached so that the colonies developing
from the bacteria will be so few that they are separate
and pure cultures may be obtained by inoculating from one
of these a tube of the appropriate medium (<a href="#fig-131" class="int-ref">Figs.&nbsp;131 to 134</a>).
The chief uncertainty with this method is that occasionally
two kinds of bacteria stick together so closely that even the
separate colonies contain both organisms. This is not
<a id="Page_195" class="pagenum" title="195"> </a>
common, however.<!--TN: changed comma to period--> The plate colonies frequently develop
from groups of bacteria which were not separated, but as
these are of the same kind the culture is essentially pure.</p>

Fig.&nbsp;133); <i>3</i>, shows the colonies larger and well separated, so that it is easy
to isolate from them (compare <a href="#fig-134" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;134</a>).</div>

×&nbsp;100. Very small, closely crowded colonies.</div>
</div>

<p>Another method which is frequently applicable with
material from human or animal sources is to (3) <em>rub the
material over the surface</em> of a slope tube or of medium solidified
in a Petri dish with a sterile heavy platinum needle,
glass rod, or cotton swab. If the bacteria are not too numerous,
pure cultures may frequently be obtained. A modification
of this method is to make a series of (4) <em>parallel
<a id="Page_196" class="pagenum" title="196"> </a>
streaks on a slope tube or plate of medium</em> with a needle inserted
<em>but once</em> into the material to be plated. On the first
streak most of the bacteria are rubbed off and a continuous
growth results, but usually on the last of a series only isolated
colonies appear, which are presumably pure. The
ideal method for securing pure cultures is to be absolutely
certain that the culture starts from a single organism.
This may be accomplished by means of the (5) <i>apparatus
and pipettes devised by Professor Barber</i> of the University of
Kansas (<a href="#fig-135" class="int-ref">Figs.&nbsp;135</a> and <a href="#fig-136" class="int-ref">136</a>). With this instrument a single
organism is picked out under the microscope and isolated in
a drop of culture medium and observed until it is seen to
divide, thus proving its viability. Transfers are then made
to the proper media. The method requires much practice
to develop the necessary skill in the making of pipettes,
determining the proper condition of the large cover-glasses
used over the isolating box, and in manipulation, but the
results fully compensate.</p>

<p>A number of procedures may be used to greatly facilitate
the above methods of isolation by taking advantage of the
different physiological properties of different organisms in a
<a id="Page_198" class="pagenum" title="198"> </a>
mixture such as ability to form spores, different resistance
to antiseptics, special food requirements, and pathogenic
properties. (<i>a</i>) If material contains resistant spores, it may
be <em>heated to temperatures high</em> enough to kill all of the organisms
except the spores (80° for half an hour, for example)
and then plated out. Or (<i>b</i>) <em>an antiseptic which restrains
the growth</em> of some organisms and not others may be placed
in the culture media (carbolic acid, various anilin dyes, (p.
162), excess acid, or alkali, ox bile, etc.), when the more resistant
organisms grow on the final plates, the others not.
<a id="Page_199" class="pagenum" title="199"> </a>
(<i>c</i>) <em>Special food substances</em> (various carbohydrates) from
which the organism desired forms special products (acids,
aldehydes) that may be shown on the plates by various indicators,
is one of the commonest means. Or media in
which certain organisms thrive and others not, so that the
former soon “crowd out” the latter (unsterilized milk for
lactic acid bacteria, inorganic media in soil bacteriology)
may be used. A combination of the general methods (<i>b</i>)
and (<i>c</i>) is much used in the separation of the organisms of
the “intestinal group” in human practice. (<i>d</i>) <em>The inoculation
of a susceptible animal</em> with a mixture suspected to
contain a given pathogenic bacterium frequently results
in the development of the latter in pure culture in the body
of an animal, from which it may be readily recovered. In
all of the above methods (except Barber’s) the first “pure
culture” obtained should be “purified” by replating in a
series of dilution plates to make sure that it is pure.</p>

STUDY OF INDIVIDUAL BACTERIA&mdash;STAINING.</h3>


<p>When an organism has been obtained in pure culture by
any of the methods described in the preceding chapter the
next step is the study of its morphology as discussed in
<a href="#CHAPTER_II" class="int-ref">Chapters II&ndash;IV</a>. This involves the use of the microscope,
and since bacteria are so small, objectives of higher power
than the student has presumably used will be needed.
Doubtless only the two-thirds inch or 16&nbsp;mm. and the one-sixth
inch or 4&nbsp;mm. objectives are all that have been used
in previous microscopic work, while for examining bacteria
a one-twelfth inch or 2&nbsp;mm. is necessary. It will have
been observed that the higher the power of the objective
the smaller is the front lens or object glass and consequently
the less is the amount of light which enters. With the use
of the one-twelfth inch or 2&nbsp;mm. objective it is necessary to
employ two devices for increasing the amount of light entering
it, with which the student is probably not familiar. One
of these is to place a drop of cedar oil between the front
lens and the object and to immerse the lens in this oil&mdash;hence
the term “oil-immersion objective;” the other is the
substage or Abbé condenser. The latter is a system of
lenses placed below the stage and so constructed as to bring
parallel rays of light&mdash;daylight&mdash;from an area much larger
than the face of the front lens of the objective to a focus
on the object to be examined, thus adding very greatly to
the amount of light entering the objective. Since the condenser
brings <em>parallel</em> rays to a focus on the object, the <em>flat-mirror</em>
is always used with the condenser when working
with daylight. With <em>artificial light close</em> to the microscope,
the concave mirror may be used to make the divergent rays
more nearly parallel and thus give better illumination.</p>

<p><a id="Page_201" class="pagenum" title="201"> </a>
The function of immersion oil is to prevent the dispersion
of considerable light that would otherwise occur owing to
refraction as the light passes up through the slide and into
the air. The accompanying diagram will help to make this
clearer (<a href="#fig-137" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;137</a>). A ray of light (<i>A B</i>) coming through the
slide will be refracted in the direction <i>B C</i> if the medium
has a lower refractive index than the slide, as air has, and
hence will not enter the objective <i>O</i>. If, however, there is
interposed between the objective and the slide a medium
which has the same refractive index as the slide, as immersion
oil has, then the ray will continue in the same direction
(<i>B D</i>) at the point <i>B</i> and hence enter the objective. Evidently
the immersion oil causes much more light to enter
the front lens and makes the field brighter and at the same
time prevents considerable refraction and dispersion of light
from the object seen and hence this appears more distinct
and sharply defined. The Abbé condenser and the oil-immersion
objective are practically always used in the
microscopic study of bacteria (<a href="#fig-138" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;138</a>).</p>

<h4 id="HANGING_DROP_SLIDE">HANGING DROP SLIDE.</h4>

<p>It is sometimes necessary to examine living bacteria and
for this purpose the device known as the “hanging drop
<a id="Page_202"> </a>
<a id="Page_203" class="pagenum" title="203"> </a>
slide” is used (<a href="#fig-139" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;139</a>). The slide has a slight concave
depression ground in the middle of one face. A ring of
vaseline is placed around this depression with the loop
needle. On a clean cover-glass, large enough to fit over the
ring of vaseline, several drops of a broth culture, or of material
from a solid culture suspended in broth or physiological
normal salt solution are placed. The slide is inverted on
the cover-glass in such a way that the ring of vaseline seals
the latter to the slide. When the whole preparation is
quickly turned cover side up, the drops are seen “hanging”
to the under side of the cover over the depression in the
slide. In examining such a preparation with the microscope
great care is necessary in order to focus on the bacteria,
without breaking the cover. To see the organisms
distinctly the <em>lower iris diaphragm of the condenser must be
nearly closed</em>, so that the light coming through consists
mainly of parallel vertical rays, otherwise the transparent
bacteria themselves refract and diffract the light and appear
blurred and indistinct. By studying living bacteria with
this device it can be determined whether they are motile or
not. The motility should not be confounded with the
familiar “Brownian movement” of all minute insoluble
inert particles which non-motile living bacteria and also
dead bacteria show. The hanging drop slide is of value
in the measurement of bacteria, since this is properly done
on the living organism. Measurement is done with a calibrated
ocular micrometer as in other kinds of measurement
with the microscope with which the student is presumably
familiar. The direct effect of various agents on living bacteria
as light, electricity, heat, etc., in the study of “tropisms”
and “taxes” has been investigated on various modifications
of the above-described hanging drop slide.</p>

“Dark field” illumination and the ultramicroscope are
of great value in the study of living bacteria and other
minute objects, but apparatus of this type would scarcely
be used by the student in an introductory course, so that
they will not be discussed in the present volume.</p>


<h4>STAINING.</h4>

<p>The main use of the microscope in bacteriology is in the
study of <em>stained preparations</em> of the organisms. Staining
makes bacteria opaque and hence more easily seen than the
transparent unstained forms. Some methods of staining
also show morphological structures which are either imperfectly
recognized in the unstained cell, spores, or are not
visible at all&mdash;capsules, metachromatic granules, flagella.
Finally certain bacteria are colored by special methods of
staining which do not affect others, so that under proper
conditions these bacteria may be recognized by staining
methods alone&mdash;tubercle bacilli in the organs of animals.</p>

<p>The phenomena of staining are essentially chemical,
though sometimes the chemical union is a very weak one,
even resembling an absorption of the dye rather than true
chemical union&mdash;most watery stains. In other cases the
chemical compounds formed are decidedly stable and are
not decomposed even by strong mineral acids&mdash;staining of
tubercle bacilli and other “acid-fast” organisms. In still
other cases the principal action is a precipitation on the
surface of the object stained&mdash;methods for staining flagella.</p>

<p>In many methods of staining in addition to the dyes used
other substances are added to the solution which assist in
fixing the dye in or on the organism stained. Such substances
are called <i class="term">mordants</i>. The principal mordants used
are alkalies, anilin, carbolic acid, iodine, metallic salts,
tannic acid.</p>

<p>While it is true that some bacteria may be stained by that
standard histological nuclear dye, hematoxylin, it is of little
value for this purpose. Practically all bacteriological stains
are solutions of the <i class="term">anilin dyes</i>. These dyes, as is well
known, are of nearly every conceivable color and shade but
<a id="Page_205" class="pagenum" title="205"> </a>
relatively very few are used in bacteriological work. The
beginning student will rarely use solutions of other than
the three dyes <i class="term">fuchsin</i> (red), <i class="term">methylene blue</i> and <i class="term">gentian
violet</i> for staining bacteria, with occasionally Bismarck
brown, or eosin, or safranin as tissue contrast stains.</p>

<p>The bacteriological dyes are kept “in stock” as saturated
solutions in 95 per cent. alcohol which are <em>never used as
stains</em>, but merely for convenience in making the various
staining solutions.</p>

<p>The approximate percentages of the three common dyes
in such solutions are indicated in the following table adapted
from Woods <cite>Chemical and Microscopical Diagnosis</cite>, Third
Edition, 1917, Appendix:</p>

<p><a id="Page_207" class="pagenum" title="207"> </a>
The actual staining of bacteriological preparations can
be learned only by repeated laboratory practice, yet the
following methods have given such uniform results in class
work that it is felt they are not out of place in a text-book.</p>

<p><b>Preparation of the “Film.”</b>&mdash;The author learned to stain
bacteria, on the “cover-glass” but does not recall having
used this method in fifteen years and does not teach it to
his students. All staining is done on the slide. To prepare
a film from a solid culture medium the procedure is as
follows:</p>

<p>First, be sure the slide is clean and <em>free from grease</em>. This
is accomplished most readily by scouring a few minutes with
finely ground pumice stone and a little water, then washing
and drying with a grease-free cloth, handkerchief<!--TN: was 'handerchief'-->, or piece
of cheese-cloth. With the “loop” needle place in the middle
of the slide a small loop of water. This is best done by
filling the loop by dipping in water, then tapping it gently
so that all that remains is the water that just fills the loop
level full, and this amount is placed on the slide by touching
the flat side of the loop to the glass. Then the <i>straight
needle</i> is sterilized, dipped into the culture and just touched
once into the small drop of water on the slide. The remainder
of the culture on the straight needle is then burned off
and the needle is used to spread the drop of water containing
the bacteria into a thin even film, which will result, provided
the slide is free from grease. This is dried and then
“fixed” by passing three times through the Bunsen flame at
intervals of about one second, passing through slowly for
thick slides and a little more rapidly for thin ones. If the
culture is in a liquid medium, the use of the loop of water is
unnecessary; a loop of the fluid from the surface, middle or
bottom as the culture indicates is spread out to a thin film,
dried and fixed.</p>

<p>After the film is fixed the stain desired is dropped on,
allowed to act for the proper time, which will depend on the
stain and the preparation, washed in water, dried thoroughly
and examined with the oil-immersion lens, without a cover.
If it is desired to preserve the preparation it may then be
mounted in balsam. This is not necessary, as they keep
<a id="Page_208" class="pagenum" title="208"> </a>
just as well, provided the immersion oil is removed. To
do this, fold a piece of filter paper so that at least three
thicknesses result. Lay this on the slide and press firmly
several times, when the surplus oil will be taken up by the
paper. Slides not mounted in balsam are more apt to
become dusty than those that are. This is the only disadvantage.</p>

<p><b>Gram’s Method of Staining.</b>&mdash;It has been ascertained
that some bacteria contain a substance, possibly a protein,
which forms a compound with gentian violet and iodine,
which compound is insoluble in alcohol, and other bacteria
do not contain this substance. Consequently when bacteria
are stained by Gram’s method (given below), those that
contain this chemical remain colored, while if it is not present
the dye is washed out by the alcohol and the bacteria are
colorless and may be stained by a contrast stain. The bacteria
which stain by this method are said to “take Gram’s”
or to be “Gram-positive,” while those that decolorize are
called “Gram-negative.” The method is:</p>

<ol class="list">
  <li>1. Prepare the film as above given.</li>

  <li>2. Stain with fresh anilin gentian violet 1 minute.</li>

  <li>3. Wash in tap water.</li>

  <li>4. Cover with Gram’s solution 1 minute.</li>

  <li>5. Wash in tap water.</li>

  <li>6. Wash with 95 per cent. alcohol three times or until no
  more color comes out.</li>

  <li>7. Dry and examine.</li>
</ol>

<p>Gram’s solution is:</p>

<table class="borders width-200" summary=""><!--TN: repeated text indicated by dittos in original text-->

  </tr>
</table>

<p>This method is excellent for differentiating Gram-positive
and Gram-negative organisms on the same slide. First
stain by this method and after washing with alcohol stain
with a counter-stain, carbol-fuchsin diluted ten to fifteen
times with water is excellent. The Gram-positive bacteria
are violet and the Gram-negative are red.</p>

<p>It is also of great value in staining Gram-positive bacteria
in tissues, but the sections should be stained about five
<a id="Page_209" class="pagenum" title="209"> </a>
minutes in the anilin gentian violet and be left about two
minutes in the Gram’s solution. Sections are to be counter-stained
in Bismarck brown, dilute eosin or safranin solutions
and cleared in oil of bergamot, lavender or origanum and
not in clove oil or carbol-xylol, as these latter dissolve out
the dye from the bacteria.</p>

<p><b>Staining of Spores in the Rod.</b>&mdash;Prepare the films as usual.
Cover with carbol-fuchsin, using plenty of stain so that it
will not dry on the slide; heat until vapor arises, not to boiling;
cool until the stain becomes cloudy and heat again
until the stain clears, and repeat once more; wash in tap
water and then wash in 1 per cent. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> three times,
dropping on plenty of acid, tilting and running this over the
slide three times and then pour off and use fresh acid and
repeat this once. Wash thoroughly in <em>distilled</em> water, then
stain with Löffler’s blue one to three minutes. Wash, dry
and examine. The spores should be bright red in a blue
rod.</p>

<p>This method will give good results if care is taken to
secure cultures of the right age. If the culture is too old
the spores will all be free outside the rods, while if too young
they will decolorize with the acid. For <i class="taxonomy">Bacillus subtilis</i> and
<i class="taxonomy">Bacillus anthracis</i>, cultures on agar slants forty-eight hours
in the 37° incubator are just right. For the spores of <i class="taxonomy">Clostridium
tetani</i>, the culture should be three days old, but may
be as old as a week.</p>

<p><b>Staining of “Acid-fast” Bacilli.</b>&mdash;<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
Mycobacterium of Johne’s disease, “grass” and “butter
bacilli,” Mycobacterium lepræ, Mycobacterium smegmatis.</i></p>

<div class="title"><i>Gabbet’s method</i>:</div>

<ol class="list">
  <li>1. Prepare the film as usual.</li>

  <li>2. Stain with carbol-fuchsin as given above for spores.</li>

  <li>3. Wash with tap water.</li>

  <li>4. Decolorize and stain at the same time with Gabbet’s
  blue, two or three minutes.</li>

  <li>5. Wash, dry and examine.</li>
</ol>

<p>The sulphuric acid in Gabbet’s blue removes the carbol-fuchsin
from everything except the “acid-fast” bacteria,
<a id="Page_210" class="pagenum" title="210"> </a>
which remain red, and the blue stains the decolorized bacteria
and nuclei of any tissue cells present.</p>

<div class="title"><i>Ziehl-Neelson method</i>:</div>

<ol class="list">
  <li>1, 2, 3, as in Gabbet’s method.</li>

  <li>4. Decolorize with 10 per cent. HCl until washing with
  water shows only a faint pink color left on slide.</li>

  <li>5. Wash thoroughly.</li>

  <li>6. Stain with Löffler’s<!--TN: was 'Löffller'--> blue one or two minutes.</li>

  <li>7. Wash, dry and examine.</li>
</ol>

<p>The results are the same as with Gabbet’s method.</p>

<p><b>Staining of Capsules.</b>&mdash;<i>Räbiger’s Method.</i>&mdash;Films of the
organism to show capsules should be <em>freshly prepared, dried
but not fixed</em>. Material is usually obtained from milk or
blood. A drop of the fluid is placed on the middle of a slide
about one-fourth of the distance from one end. The narrow
edge of another clean slide is placed in this drop and then
drawn lengthwise across the slide with firm pressure. This
gives a <em>thin layer</em> which is necessary if good results are to be
expected. The preparation is covered with a <em>freshly prepared</em>
saturated solution of gentian violet in formalin and
this allowed to stain for 30 seconds. Then wash <em>lightly</em>,
dry and examine. The organisms appear deeply violet
and much larger than with ordinary stains and capsules
are well stained and show well.</p>

<p><i>Welch’s Method.</i>&mdash;Prepare films as in the above method.
Cover with glacial acetic acid for 10 to 20 seconds. Wash
off the acid with carbol-fuchsin. Wash the stain off with
physiological normal salt solution (0.85 per cent.) until all
surplus stain is removed. Dry and examine. Capsules and
bacteria are red.</p>

<p><b>Staining of Flagella.</b>&mdash;The rendering of flagella visible is
considered one of the most difficult processes in staining.
Experience of a number of years during which whole classes
numbering from one hundred to three hundred students
accomplish this result shows that it is no more difficult than
many other staining processes. The essentials are: (1)
clean slides, (2) young cultures on agar slopes, (3) freshly
prepared mordant and stain which are kept free from precipitate,
<a id="Page_211" class="pagenum" title="211"> </a>
(4) gentle heating. The author’s students are furnished
only stock materials and make their own cultures,
mordants and stains.</p>

<p>The slides are cleaned with pumice in the usual way. An
agar slope culture of the organism to be stained from six to
twenty-four hours old is selected. A bit of the culture is
removed and placed in a watch-glass of water. The bacteria
are allowed to diffuse of themselves without stirring.
After several minutes a loop of this water is removed and
three streaks are made across the slide, one in the middle
and one on each side of this about one-quarter of an inch
from it. This gives well scattered bacteria in one of the
three streaks at least and very little other material on the
slide to cause precipitates<!--TN: was 'preciptates'-->. The slide is carefully dried and
fixed and then covered with an abundance of the mordant
by filtering through a small filter onto the slide so that the
mordant shows transparent on the slide. The preparation
is then gently warmed and cooled three times, adding mordant
if necessary. <em>Do not heat to steaming.</em> After mordanting
for about five minutes the excess is washed off under the
tap. It is a good plan to hold the slide level and allow the
water to run into the center of the mordant and flow it off.
Inclining the slide is apt to cause the film on the surface of
the mordant to settle down on the slide and spoil the preparation.
After the mordant is washed off and all traces of it
removed with a clean cloth if necessary the stain is applied
and gently heated and cooled the same way for from three
to five minutes. The preparation is then washed, dried and
examined.</p>

<p>The mordant used is a modification of Löffler’s which is
somewhat simpler in preparation since the stock solution of
FeCl<sub>3</sub> is more permanent than FeSO<sub>4</sub> solution.</p>

<p>Mordant sufficient for one student:</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>The solution of FeCl<sub>3</sub> is made up in the cold and must be
perfectly clear. The tannic acid solution must be thoroughly
<a id="Page_212" class="pagenum" title="212"> </a>
boiled and filtered until clear. The iron and the acid
are carefully mixed, boiled and filtered clear. The anilin
fuchsin must be added slowly with constant stirring and the
mixture boiled and filtered. The NaOH is added in the
same way and this mixture boiled and filtered. The final
mordant should not leave a film on a clean slide when
poured on and allowed to run off. Unless the mordant is in
this condition and perfectly clear, it should not be used, but
a new one must be made up. Time and care in the preparation
of the mordant are essential.</p>

<p>The stain to follow this mordant is anilin fuchsin.</p>

<p><b>Staining of Metachromatic Granules.</b>&mdash;<i>Neisser’s Method.</i>
Prepare the film in the usual way. Stain with Neisser’s
stain a few seconds only. Wash and stain with Bismarck
brown a few seconds only.</p>

<p>By the use of the hanging drop slide and the methods of
staining just described all the various morphological features
of the bacterial cell may be ascertained.</p>

<p>It is necessary when <i>cell groupings</i> as characteristic of
definite modes of division are to be determined to make
slides from a liquid culture, as broth. Place a drop of the
material, preferably from the bottom of the tube in most
instances, from the top in case a pellicle or scum is formed
on the surface, on the slide and allow this to dry <em>without
spreading it out</em>, fix, wash gently with water, then stain
lightly with Löffler’s blue. Such slides also show characteristic
<i class="term">cell forms</i> as well. Slides should be made from solid
media to show variations in form and size and involution
forms. These latter are especially apt to occur on potato
media.</p>

STUDY OF THE PHYSIOLOGY OF BACTERIA.</h3>


<p>Of the environmental conditions influencing the growth
of bacteria the following are the chief ones ordinarily determined:</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Temperature.&mdash;The optimum temperature for growth
is usually about the temperature of the natural environment
and ordinarily one determines merely whether the organism
grows at body temperature (37°)<!--TN: added closing parenthesis--> and at room temperature
(20°) or not. For exact work the maximum, minimum and
optimum temperature must be ascertained by growing in
“incubators” with varying temperatures.</p>

<p>A bacteriological incubator is an apparatus for growing
bacteria at a constant temperature. This may be any temperature
within the limits for bacterial growth. If temperatures
above that of an ordinary room are desired, some
source of artificial heat is needed. Electricity, gas or oil
may be used. A necessary adjunct is some device for maintaining
the temperature constant, a “thermoregulator” or
“thermostat.” For lower temperatures a cooling arrangement
must be installed. For the great part of bacteriological
work only two temperatures are used, 20° so-called “room
temperature” (this applies to European “rooms” not to
American) and 37° or body temperature. Incubators for
37° of almost any size and style desired may be secured from
supply houses and need not be further described. <a href="#fig-141" class="int-ref">Figs.&nbsp;141</a>
and <a href="#fig-142" class="int-ref">142</a> illustrate some of the types.</p>

<p>For use with large classes “incubator rooms” are to be
preferred. The author has one such room for 37° work with
200 compartments for student use which did not cost over
$60 to install.</p>

<p>The thermal death-point is determined by exposing the
organisms in thin tubes of broth at varying temperatures
for ten-minute periods and then plating out to determine
growth. The effect of heat may also be determined by
exposing at a given temperature, <i>e.g.</i>, 60°, for varying
lengths of time and plating out.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> Oxygen relations&mdash;whether the organism is aërobic,

<p>Among the “Physiological Activities” discussed in <a href="#CHAPTER_IX" class="int-ref">Chapters
IX&ndash;XII</a> those which, in addition to the staining reactions
described, are of most use in the identification of
non-pathogenic bacteria are the first ten listed below. For
pathogenic bacteria the entire thirteen are needed.</p>

<p>1. Liquefaction of gelatin.</p>

<p>2. Digestion of blood serum.</p>

<p>3. Coagulation and digestion of milk.</p>

<p>4. Acid or gaseous fermentation in milk, or both.</p>

<p>5. Acid or gaseous fermentation of various carbohydrates
in carbohydrate broth, or both.</p>

<p>6. Production of indol in “indol solution.”</p>

<p>7. Production of pigments on various media.</p>

<p>8. Reduction of nitrates to nitrites, ammonia, or free
nitrogen.</p>

<p>9. Production of enzymes as illustrated in the above
activities.</p>

<p>10. Appearance of growth on different culture media.</p>

<p>11. Production of free toxins as determined by injection
of animals with broth cultures filtered free from bacteria.</p>

<p>12. Causation of disease as ascertained by the injection
of animals with the bacteria themselves, and recovery of the
organism from the animals.</p>

<p>13. Formation of specific antibodies as determined by the
proper injection of animals with the organism or its products
and the subsequent testing of the blood serum of the inoculated
animals.</p>

<p><a id="Page_217" class="pagenum" title="217"> </a>
For special kinds of bacteria other activities must be
determined (oxidation, nitrate and nitrite formation, action
of sulphur and iron bacteria, etc.).</p>

<p>The first nine activities are determined by inoculating
the different culture media already described and observing
the phenomena indicated, making chemical tests where
necessary.</p>


<h4 id="APPEARANCE_OF_GROWTH">APPEARANCE OF GROWTH ON DIFFERENT CULTURE
MEDIA.</h4>

<p>In addition to those changes that are associated with the
manifestation of different physiological activities, many
bacteria, show characteristic appearances on the various culture
media which are of value in their identification.</p>

<p>Too much stress should not be laid on these appearances
alone, however, since slight variations, particularly in solid
media due especially to the age of the medium, may change
decidedly the appearance of a colony. This is true of
variations in the amount of moisture on agar plates. Colonies
which are ordinarily round and regular may assume
very diverse shapes, if there chance to be an excess of moisture
on the surface.</p>

<p>Also in slope and puncture cultures on the various solid
media much variation results from the amount of material
on the inoculation needle and just how the puncture is
made, or the needle drawn over the slope. These variations
are largely prevented by the use of standard media and by
inoculating by standard methods. The Laboratory Committee
of the American Public Health Association has proposed
standard methods for all culture media and tests and
for methods of inoculation, and these have been generally
adopted in this country for comparative work.</p>

<p>Likewise the Society of American Bacteriologists has
at different times (1904, 1914, 1917) adopted “descriptive
charts” for detailing all the characteristics of a given organism.
A committee is at present working on a revision<!--TN: was 'revission'-->
of the 1917 chart to be presented at the 1920 meeting. One
of the earlier charts which includes a glossary of descriptive
terms is <a href="#chart" class="int-ref">inserted in this chapter</a>.</p>

Among the cultural appearances the following are of most
importance:</p>

<p>In broth cultures the presence or absence of growth on
the surface and the amount of the same. Whether the
<a id="Page_219" class="pagenum" title="219"> </a>
broth is rendered cloudy or remains clear, and whether there
is a deposit at the bottom or not (<a href="#fig-144" class="int-ref">Fig.&nbsp;144</a>). An abundant
surface growth with little or nothing below indicates a strict
aërobe, while a growth or deposit at bottom and a clear or
nearly clear medium above, an anaërobe. These appearances
are for the first few days only of growth. If the broth
is disturbed, or after the culture stands for several days
many surface growths tend to sink to the bottom. So an
actively motile organism causes in general a cloudiness,
especially if the organism is a facultative anaërobe, which
tends to clear up by precipitation after several days when
the organisms lose their motility. Non-motile facultative
<a id="Page_220" class="pagenum" title="220"> </a>
anaërobes usually cloud the broth also, but settle out more
rapidly than the motile ones.</p>

<p>In gelatin and agar punctures the oxygen relationship is
shown by surface growth for aërobes, growth near the
bottom of the puncture for anaërobes, and a fairly uniform
growth all along the line of inoculation for facultative
anaërobes<!--TN: was 'anërobes'-->. In the case of these last organisms, a preference
for more or less oxygen is indicated by the approach to the
aërobic or anaërobic type of growth.</p>

<p>Colonies of mold frequently appear on plates. These are
readily differentiated from bacterial colonies after a little
experience. With the naked eye usually the fine radiations
of the edge of the colony are apparent. The surface appears
duller and by reflected light more or less “fuzzy.” With
the low-power objective the relatively large, branching
threads of the mold (mycelia) show distinctly. Also the
large fruiting bodies (sporangia) are easily distinguished.

ANIMAL INOCULATION.</h3>


<p>Animal inoculation has been referred to (1) as a method
of assisting in the preparation of pure cultures of pathogenic
organisms; (2) as a means of testing the poisonous
properties of substances produced in bacterial cultures; (3)
in order to test the ability of an organism to cause a disease;
(4) for the production of various antibodies; it may be added
(5) that some bacteria produce in the smaller experimental
animals lesions which do not occur in animals naturally
infected, but which nevertheless are characteristic for the
given organism. The best illustration is the testicular reaction
of young male guinea-pigs to intraperitoneal injections
of glanders bacilli. Experimental animals are also inoculated
(6) to test the potency of various bacterial and other
biological products, as toxins, antitoxins, etc.</p>

<p>Guinea-pigs are the most widely used experimental animals
because they are easily kept and are susceptible to
so many diseases on artificial inoculation. Rabbits are used
very largely also, as are white mice. For special purposes
white rats, pigeons, goats and swine are necessary. For
commercial products horses (antitoxins) and cattle (smallpox
vaccine) are employed. In the study of many human
diseases the higher monkeys and even the anthropoid apes
are necessary, since none of the lower animals are susceptible.</p>

<p>The commonest method of animal inoculation is undoubtedly
the <i class="term">subcutaneous</i>. This is accomplished most readily
with the hypodermic needle. The skin at the point selected
(usually in guinea-pigs the lateral posterior half of the
abdominal surface, in mice the back near the root of the
tail) is pinched up to avoid entering the muscles and the
needle quickly inserted. Clipping the hairs and washing
with an antiseptic solution should precede the inoculation
as routine practice. Frequently a small “skin pocket” is
all that is needed. The hair is clipped off, the skin pinched
up with small forceps and a slight snip with sharp scissors
<a id="Page_228" class="pagenum" title="228"> </a>
is made. The material may be inserted into this pocket
with a heavy platinum needle. <i class="term">Cutaneous</i> inoculation is
made by shaving the skin and rubbing the material onto
the shaved surface or scratching with a scalpel or special
scarifier, but without drawing blood, and then rubbing in
the material to be inoculated.</p>

<p><i class="term">Intravenous</i> injections are made with larger animals. In
rabbits the posterior external auricular is a convenient vein.
In larger animals the external jugular is used.</p>

<p><i class="term">Intraperitoneal</i>, <i class="term">-thoracic</i>, <i class="term">-cardiac</i>, <i class="term">-ocular</i>, <i class="term">-muscular</i> injections,
and injections into the parenchyma of internal organs
are accomplished with the hypodermic needle. In the case
of the first two, injury to contained organs should be carefully
avoided. Intracardiac injection, or aspiration of the
heart to secure blood, requires considerable practice to be
successful without causing the death of the animal at once
through internal hemorrhage. In <i class="term">subdural</i> injections into
the cranial cavity it is necessary to trephine the skull first,
while such injections into the spinal canal may be accomplished
between the vertebra with needles longer and
stronger than the usual hypodermic needle. Occasionally
animals are caused to <i>inhale</i> the organisms, or are <i>fed</i> cultures
mixed with the feed.</p>


<h4 id="SECURING_AND_TRANSPORTING_MATERIAL">SECURING AND TRANSPORTING MATERIAL FROM
ANIMALS FOR BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION.</h4>

<p>If the site of the lesion is readily accessible from the
exterior, material from the <i>living animal</i> should be collected
with sterile instruments and kept in sterile utensils until the
necessary tests can be made. Testing should be done on
material as soon after collection as possible, in all cases, to
avoid the effects of “decomposition” bacteria.</p>

<p>If the blood is to be investigated it may be aspirated from
a peripheral vein with a sterile hypodermic syringe of appropriate
size or allowed to flow through a sterile canula into
sterile receptacles. The site of the puncture should be
shaved and disinfected before the instrument is introduced.</p>

<p>Discharges of whatever kind should likewise be collected
in sterile receptacles and examined as soon as may be.</p>

<p><a id="Page_229" class="pagenum" title="229"> </a>
If internal organs are to be examined it is best to kill a
moribund animal than to wait for death, since after death,
and in severe infections even sometimes before, the tissues
are rapidly invaded by saprophytic bacteria from the alimentary
and respiratory tracts which complicate greatly
the isolation of the specific organism. Hence the search for
specific bacteria in carcasses or organs several hours after
death is frequently negative. Animal inoculation with such
material is very often followed by sepsis or septicemia in a
few hours, so that the specific organism has no opportunity
to manifest itself.</p>

<p>In securing material for cultures from internal organs it
is a good plan to burn the surface of the organ with a gas
or alcohol flame, or to sear it with a hot instrument to kill
surface organisms, then make the incision or puncture
through the burned area and secure material from the interior
of the organ. Such punctures made with a stiff platinum
needle frequently give pure cultures of the organism
sought. Slides may be made from such material and culture
media inoculated at once.</p>

<p>Since a bacteriological diagnosis depends most commonly
on growing the organisms, it is evident that material sent
for examination must <em>never be treated with an antiseptic or preservative</em>.
If decomposition is to be feared the only safe procedure
is to <em>pack the material in ice</em> and forward in this way.</p>

<p><i>Tuberculous material from the parenchyma</i> of internal
organs may be forwarded in a preservative (not <i>formalin</i>,
since this makes it very difficult to stain the bacteria) as <em>in
this special</em> case a very positive diagnosis may be made by
staining alone. Even here it is better to <i>pack in ice</i> in
order that the diagnosis by staining may be confirmed by
inoculating the living organisms into guinea-pigs.</p>

<p>In the case of material <em>from a rabid animal</em> and many
protozoal diseases the rule against preservatives is not absolute,
since staining is a reliable diagnostic means. Even
in these cases it is often desirable to inoculate animals,
hence, as before stated, it is best to make it a uniform practice
to <em>pack material for examination in ice and use no preservatives</em>.</p>

GENERAL PATHOGENIC BACTERIOLOGY.</h2>

<h3 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.<br />

INTRODUCTION.</h3>


<p>Pathogenic Bacteriology treats of the unicellular microörganisms<!--TN: was 'microorganisms' [split across line]-->
which are responsible for disease conditions, <i>i.e.</i>,
pathological changes in other organisms. Hence not only
are bacteria considered, but also other low vegetable forms,
as yeasts and molds, likewise protozoa in so far as they
may be pathogenic. For this reason the term pathogenic
“Microbiology” has been introduced to include all these
organisms. It is largely for the reason that the methods
devised for the study of bacteria have been applied to the
investigation of other microörganisms that the term “bacteriology”
was extended to cover the entire field. The
general discussion in this chapter is intended to include,
therefore, microörganisms of whatever kind pathogenic to
animals.</p>

<p>The term pathogenic as applied to an organism must be
understood in a purely <em>relative</em> sense, since there is no single
organism that can cause disease in all of a certain class, but
each is limited to a more or less narrow range. Some form
of tuberculosis attacks nearly all vertebrates, but no other
classes of animals and no plants. Lockjaw or tetanus
attacks most mammals, but not any other vertebrates
naturally. Typhoid fever affects human beings; hog cholera,
swine, etc. This point is more fully discussed in <a href="#CHAPTER_XXIII" class="int-ref">Chapter
XXIII</a> but can not be too greatly insisted upon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">“The greatest enemy to mankind is man.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="continued">Exceptions to this statement do occur and are important
and must be considered in efforts to protect completely
<a id="Page_232" class="pagenum" title="232"> </a>
human beings from disease (tuberculosis from cattle, glanders
from horses, poisoning from spoiled canned goods, anthrax
from hair, hides, wool, of animals dead of the disease),
but the most common human diseases are derived from other
human beings directly or indirectly.</p>

<p>Diseases which are due to unicellular pathogenic microörganisms<!--TN: was 'microorganisms' [split across line]-->
are called <i class="term">infectious</i> diseases, while if such diseases
are transmitted under natural conditions from organism to
organism they are spoken of as <i class="term">contagious</i> diseases. Most
infectious diseases are contagious but not all. Tetanus is
a good illustration of a non-contagious infectious disease.
There are very few such diseases.</p>

<p>When a unicellular microörganism gains entrance into the
body and brings about any pathological changes there, the
result is an <i class="term">infection</i>. Undoubtedly many pathogenic organisms
get into the body but never manifest their presence by
causing disease conditions, hence do not cause an infection.
It is the pathological conditions which result that constitute
the infection, and not the mere <i class="term">invasion</i>.</p>

<p>The time that elapses between the entrance of the organism
and the appearance of symptoms is called the <i class="term">period of
incubation</i> and varies greatly in different diseases.</p>

<p>The term <i class="term">infestation</i> is used to denote pathological conditions
due to <i>multicellular</i> parasites. Thus an animal is
<em>infested</em> (not infected) with tapeworms, roundworms, lice,
mites, etc. Many of these conditions, probably all, are
contagious, <i>i.e.</i>, transmissable naturally from animal to
animal. The word <i class="term">contagious</i> has been used in a variety
of ways to mean <i>communicated by direct contact</i>, communicated
by a living something (<i class="term">contagium</i>) that might be carried
to a distance and finally <i>communicable</i> in any manner,
transmissable. The agency of transmission may be very
roundabout&mdash;as through a <i>special tick</i> in Texas fever, a
<i>mosquito</i> in malaria, etc.,&mdash;or by direct personal contact, as
generally in venereal diseases. After all, though exactness
is necessary, it is better to learn all possible about the <em>means
of transmission of diseases</em>, than quibble as to the terms to
be used.</p>

<p><a id="Page_233" class="pagenum" title="233"> </a>
An infectious disease may be <i class="term">acute</i> or <i class="term">chronic</i>. An acute
infection is one which runs for a relatively short time and is
“self-limited,” so-called, <i>i.e.</i>, the organisms cease to manifest
their presence after a time. In some acute infections
the time is very short&mdash;German measles usually runs five
or six days. Typhoid fever may continue eight to ten
weeks, sometimes longer, yet it is an acute infectious disease.
It is not so much the time as the fact of <i class="term">self-limitation</i><!--TN: was 'self-limitaion'-->
that characterizes acute infections.</p>

<p>In chronic infections there is little or no evidence of limitation
of the progress of the disease which may continue for
years. Tuberculosis is usually chronic. Leprosy in man is
practically always so. Glanders in horses is most commonly
chronic; in mules and in man it is more apt to be acute.</p>

<p>Many infections begin acutely and later change to the
chronic type. Syphilis in man is a good illustration.</p>

<p>The differences between acute and chronic infections are
partly due to the nature of the organism, partly to the number
of organisms introduced and the point of their introduction
and partly to the resistance of the animal infected.</p>

<p>An infectious disease is said to be <i class="term">specific</i> when one kind
of organism is responsible for its manifestations&mdash;as diphtheria
due to the <i class="taxonomy">Corynebacterium diphtheriæ</i>, lockjaw due to
<i class="taxonomy">Clostridium tetani</i>, Texas fever due to the <i class="taxonomy">Piroplasma
bigeminum</i>, etc. It is <i class="term">non-specific</i> when it may be due to a
variety of organisms, as <i>enteritis</i> (generally), <i>bronchopneumonia</i>,
<i>wound infections</i>.</p>

<p>Henle, as early as 1840, stated certain principles that
must be established before a given organism can be accepted
as the cause of a specific disease. These were afterward
restated by Koch, and have come to be known as “Koch’s
postulates.” They may be stated as follows:</p>

<p>1. The given organism must be found in all cases of the
disease in question.</p>

<p>2. No other organism must be found in all cases.</p>

<p>3. The organism must, when obtained in pure culture,
reproduce the disease in susceptible animals.</p>

<p>4. It must be recovered from such animals in pure culture
and this culture likewise reproduce the disease.</p>

<p><a id="Page_234" class="pagenum" title="234"> </a>
These postulates have not been fully met with reference
to any disease, but the principles embodied have been applied
as far as possible in all those infections which we recognize
as specific, and whose causative agent is accepted. In many
diseases recognized as infectious and contagious no organism
has been found which is regarded as the specific cause. In
some of these the organism appears to be too small to be
seen with the highest powers of the microscope, hence they
are called “<i class="term">ultramicroscopic</i>” organisms. Because these
agents pass through the finest bacterial filters, they are also
frequently called “<i class="term">filterable</i>.” The term “<i class="term">virus</i>” or “<i class="term">filterable
virus</i>” is likewise applied to these “ultramicroscopic”
and “filterable” agents.</p>

<p>The term <i class="term">primary infection</i> is sometimes applied to the
first manifestation of a disease, either specific or non-specific,
while <i class="term">secondary</i> refers to later developments. For example,
a <i class="term">secondary</i> general infection may follow a <i class="term">primary</i> wound
infection, or <i class="term">primary</i> lung tuberculosis be followed by <i class="term">secondary</i>
generalized tuberculosis, or <i class="term">primary</i> typhoid fever by a
<i class="term">secondary</i> typhoid pneumonia. The terms <i class="term">primary</i> and
<i class="term">secondary</i> are also used where the body is invaded by one
kind of an organism and later on by another kind; thus a
<i class="term">primary</i> measles may be followed by <i class="term">secondary</i> infection of
the middle ear, or a <i class="term">primary</i> influenza may be followed by a
<i class="term">secondary</i> pneumonia, or a <i class="term">primary</i> scarlet fever by a <i class="term">secondary</i>
nephritis (inflammation of the kidney). Where several
organisms seem to be associated simultaneously in causing
the condition then the term <i class="term">mixed infection</i> is used&mdash;in
severe diphtheria, streptococci are commonly associated with
the <i class="taxonomy">Corynebacterium diphtheriæ</i>. In many cases of hog-cholera,
mixed infections in the lungs and in the intestines are common.
Wound infections are usually <i class="term">mixed</i>. <i class="term">Auto-infection</i>
refers to those conditions in which an organism commonly
present in or on the body in a latent or harmless condition
gives rise to an infectious process. If the <i class="taxonomy">Bacterium coli</i> normal
to the intestine escapes into the peritoneal cavity, or
passes into the bladder, a severe peritonitis or cystitis, respectively,
is apt to result. “Boils” and “pimples” are
frequently autoinfections. Such infections are also spoken
<a id="Page_235" class="pagenum" title="235"> </a>
of as <i class="term">endogenous</i> to distinguish them from those due to the
entrance of organisms from without&mdash;<i class="term">exogenous</i> infections.
<i class="term">Relapses</i> are usually instances of autoinfection.</p>

<p>Those types of <i class="term">secondary infection</i> where the infecting
agent is transferred from one disease focus to another or
several other points and sets up the infection there are
sometimes called <i class="term">metastases</i>. Such are the transfer of tubercle
bacilli from lung to intestine, spleen, etc., the formation
of abscesses in internal organs following a primary surface
abscess, the appearance of glanders nodules throughout
various organs following pulmonary glanders, etc.</p>

<p>The characteristic of a pathogenic microörganism which
indicates its ability to cause disease is called its <i class="term">virulence</i>.
If slightly virulent, the effect is slight; if highly virulent, the
effect is severe, and may be fatal.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the characteristic of the host which
indicates its capacity for infection is called <i class="term">susceptibility</i>.
If slightly susceptible, infection is slight, if highly susceptible,
the infection is severe.</p>

<p>Evidently the degree of infection is dependent in large
measure on the relation between the <i class="term">virulence</i> of the invading
organism and the <i class="term">susceptibility</i> of the host. High virulence
and great susceptibility mean a severe infection; low
virulence and little susceptibility a slight infection; while
high virulence and little susceptibility or low virulence
and great susceptibility might mean a moderate infection
varying in either direction. Other factors influencing the
degree of infection are the number of organisms introduced,
the point where they are introduced and various conditions.
These will be discussed in another connection (<a href="#CHAPTER_XXV" class="int-ref">Chapter
XXV</a>).</p>

<p>The study of pathogenic bacteriology includes the thorough
study of the individual organisms according to the
methods already given (<a href="#CHAPTER_XVIII" class="int-ref">Chapters XVIII&ndash;XXI</a>) as an aid to
diagnosis and subsequent treatment, bacteriological or other,
in a given disease. Of far greater importance than the
<i>treatment</i>, which in most infectious diseases is not specific,
is the <i>prevention</i> and <i>ultimate eradication</i> of all infectious
diseases. To accomplish these objects involves further a
<a id="Page_236" class="pagenum" title="236"> </a>
study of the <em>conditions under which pathogenic organisms
exist outside the body</em>, <em>the paths of entrance into and elimination
from the body</em> and those <em>agencies within the body itself</em>
which make it <em>less susceptible to infection or overcome the
infective agent after its introduction</em>. That condition of the
body itself which prevents any manifestation of a virulent
pathogenic organism after it has been once introduced is
spoken of as <i class="term">immunity</i> in the modern sense. Immunity is
thus the opposite of susceptibility and may exist in varying
degrees.</p>

<p>That scientists are and have been for some years in possession
of sufficient knowledge to permit of the prevention and
eradication of most, if not all, of our infectious diseases can
scarcely be questioned. The practical application of this
knowledge presents many difficulties, the chief of which is
the absence of a public sufficiently enlightened to permit the
expenditure of the necessary funds. Time and educative
effort alone can surmount this difficulty. It will probably
be years yet, but it will certainly be accomplished.</p>

PATHOGENIC BACTERIA OUTSIDE THE BODY.</h3>


<p>Pathogenic bacteria may exist outside the body of the
host under a variety of conditions as follows:</p>

<ol class="list">
<li>I. In or on inanimate objects or material.
  <ol>
  <li>(<i>a</i>) As true saprophytes.</li>
  <li>(<i>b</i>) As facultative saprophytes.</li>
  <li>(<i>c</i>) Though obligate parasites, they exist in a latent
      state.</li>
  </ol>
</li>
<li>II. In or on other animals, or products from them:
  <ol>
  <li>A. Susceptible to the disease.
    <ol>
    <li>(<i>a</i>) Sick themselves.
      (As far as human beings are concerned these are
      mainly:
      <ol>
      <li>1. Other human beings for most diseases.</li>
      <li>2. Rats for plague.</li>
      <li>3. Dogs for rabies.</li>
      <li>4. Horses for glanders.</li>
      <li>5. Cattle, swine, parrots for tuberculosis).</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>(<i>b</i>) Recovered from illness.</li>
    <li>(<i>c</i>) Never sick but “carriers.”</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>B. Not susceptible.
    <ol>
    <li>(<i>d</i>) Accidental carriers.</li>
    <li>(<i>e</i>) Serving as necessary intermediate hosts for certain
      stages of the parasite&mdash;this applies to <em>protozoal</em>
      diseases only, as yet.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  </ol>
</li>
</ol>


<h4>I.</h4>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The bacilli of tetanus, malignant edema and the
organisms of “gas gangrene” are widely distributed. There
is no evidence that their entrance into the body is at all
necessary for the continuation of their life processes, or that
<a id="Page_238" class="pagenum" title="238"> </a>
one case of either of these diseases ever has any connection
with any other case; they are true saprophytes. Manifestly
it would be futile to attempt to prevent or eradicate such
diseases by attacking the organism in its natural habitat.
<i class="taxonomy">Clostridium botulinum</i>, which causes a type of food poisoning in
man, does not even multiply in the body, but the disease
symptoms are due to a soluble toxin which is produced during
its growth outside the body.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Organisms like the bacterium of anthrax and the
bacillus of black-leg from their local occurrence seem to be
distributed from animals infected, though capable of a
saprophytic existence outside the body for years. These
can no more be attacked during their saprophytic existence
than those just mentioned. Doubtless in warm seasons of
the year and in the tropics other organisms pathogenic to
animals may live and multiply in water or in damp soil
where conditions are favorable, just as the cholera organism
in India, and occasionally the typhoid bacillus in temperate
climates do.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Most pathogenic organisms, however, when they are
thrown off from the bodies of animals, remain quiescent, do
not multiply, in fact always tend to die out from lack of all
that is implied in a “favorable environment,” food, moisture,
temperature, light, etc. Disinfection is sometimes effective
in this class of diseases in preventing new cases.</p>


<h4 id="II_A">II. A.</h4>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The most common infectious diseases of animals
are transmitted more or less directly from other animals of
the same species. Human beings get nearly all their diseases
from other human beings who are sick; horses, from
other horses; cattle, from other cattle; swine, from swine,
etc. Occasionally transmission from one species to another
occurs. Tuberculosis of swine most frequently results from
feeding them milk of tuberculous cattle or from their eating
the droppings of such cattle. Human beings occasionally
contract anthrax from wool, hair and hides of animals dead
of the disease or from postmortems on such animals; glanders
from horses; tuberculosis (in children) from tuberculous
<a id="Page_239" class="pagenum" title="239"> </a>
milk; bubonic plague from rats; rabies practically always
from the bites of dogs and other rabid animals, etc. The
mode of limiting this class of diseases is evidently to isolate
the sick, disinfect their discharges and their <em>immediate</em> surroundings,
sterilize such products as must be handled or
used, kill lower animals that are dangerous, and disinfect,
bury properly, or destroy their carcasses.</p>

<p>Classes of the sick that are especially dangerous for the
spread of disease are the mild cases and the undetected cases.
These individuals do not come under observation and hence
not under control.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) This class of carriers offers a difficult problem in the
prevention of infectious diseases since they may continue to
give off the organisms indefinitely and thus infect others.
Typhoid carriers have been known to do so for fifty-five
years. Cholera, diphtheria, meningitis and other carriers
are well known in human practice. Carriers among animals
have not been so frequently demonstrated, but there is
every reason for thinking that hog-cholera, distemper, roup,
influenza and other carriers are common. Carriers furnish
the explanation for many of the so-called “spontaneous”
outbreaks of disease among men and animals.</p>

<p>It is the general rule that those who are sick cease to carry
the organisms on recovery and it is the occasional ones who
do not that are the exceptions. In those diseases in which
the organism is known it can be determined by examination
of the patient or his discharges how long he continues to
give off the causative agent. In those in which the cause
is unknown (in human beings, the commonest and most
easily transmitted diseases, scarlet fever, measles, German
measles, mumps, chicken-pox, small-pox, influenza), no such
check is possible. It is not known how long such individuals
remain carriers. Hence isolation and quarantine of
such convalescents is based partly on experience and partly
on theory. It is highly probable that in the diseases just
mentioned transmission occurs in the <em>early stages only</em>, except
in small-pox and chicken-pox where the organism seems
to be in the pustules and transmission by means of material
from these is possible, though only by direct contact with it.</p>

<p><a id="Page_240" class="pagenum" title="240"> </a>
The fact that such individuals are <em>known to have had the
disease</em> is a guide for control. The methods to be used are
essentially the same as for the sick, (<i>a</i>), though obviously
such human carriers are much more difficult to deal with
since they are well.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Another class of carriers is those who have never had
the disease. Such individuals are common and are very
dangerous sources of infection. Many of them have <em>associated
with the sick or with convalescents</em> and these should
always be suspected of harboring the organisms. Their
control differs in no way from that of class (<i>b</i>). Unfortunately
a history of such association is too often not available.
Modern transportation and modern social habits are largely
responsible for the nearly universal distribution of this type
of carrier. Their detection is probably the largest single
problem in the prevention of infectious diseases. A partial
solution would be universal bacteriological examination.
In our present stage of progress this is impossible and would
not detect carriers of diseases of unknown cause.</p>

<p>The various classes of carriers just discussed are in a
large part responsible for the continued presence of the
commoner diseases throughout the country. The difficulties
in control have been mentioned. A complete solution
of the problem is not yet obtained. The army experience
of the past few years in the control of infectious diseases
shows what may be done.</p>

<p>There is another class of carriers which might be called
the “universal carrier,” <i>i.e.</i>, there are certain organisms
which seem to be constantly or almost constantly present
in or on the human body. These are <i class="term">micrococci</i>, <i class="term">streptococci</i>
and <i class="term">pneumococci</i>, all <i class="term">Gram positive</i> organisms. They
are ordinarily harmless parasites, but on occasion may give
rise to serious, even fatal, infection. Infected wounds,
pimples, boils, “common colds,” most “sore throats,”
bronchitis, pneumonia are pathological conditions that come
in this class. Such infections are usually autogenous.
There is a constant interchange of these organisms among
individuals closely associated, so that all of a group usually
harbor the same type though no one individual can be
<a id="Page_241" class="pagenum" title="241"> </a>
called <em>the</em> carrier. Whenever, for any reason, the resistance
of an individual (see <a href="#CHAPTER_XXV" class="int-ref">Chaps. XXV</a> et seq.) is lowered either
locally or generally some of these organisms are liable to
gain a foothold and cause infection. It sometimes happens
that a strain of dangerous organisms may be developed in
an individual in this way which is passed around to others
with its virulence increased and thus cause an epidemic.
Or, since all of the group are living under the same conditions
the resistance of all or many of them may be lowered from
the same general cause and an epidemic result from the
organism common to all (pneumonia after measles, scarlet
fever and influenza in camps). Protection of the individual
is chiefly a personal question, <i>i.e.</i>, by keeping up the “normal
healthy tone” in all possible ways: The use of protective
vaccines (<a href="#CHAPTER_XXX" class="int-ref">Chap. XXX</a>) appears to be advisable in such
instances (colds, pneumonia after measles and influenza,
inflammation of throat and middle ear following scarlet
fever and measles). Results obtained in this country during
the recent influenza epidemic have been conflicting but
on the whole appear to show that preventive vaccination
against <em>pneumonia liable to follow</em> should be practiced.</p>

<p>It would seem that among groups of individuals where
infection may be expected the proper procedure would be
to prepare autogenous vaccines (<a href="#CHAPTER_XXX" class="int-ref">Chapter XXX</a>) from members
of the group and vaccinate all with the object of protecting
them.</p>


<h4 id="II_B">II. B.</h4>

<p>(<i>d</i>) In this class come the “accidental carriers” like flies,
fleas, lice, bed-bugs, ticks, and other biting and blood-sucking
insects, vultures, buzzards, foxes, rats, and carrion-eating
animals generally; pet animals in the household, etc.
Here the animals are not susceptible to the given disease
but become contaminated with the organisms and then
through defilement of the food or drink or contact with
individuals or with utensils pass the organisms on to the
susceptible. Some biting and blood-sucking insects transmit
the organisms through biting infected and non-infected
animals successively. The spirilloses and trypanosomiases
<a id="Page_242" class="pagenum" title="242"> </a>
seem to be transmitted in this way, though there is evidence
accumulating which may place these diseases in the next
class. Anthrax is considered in some instances to be transmitted
by flies and by vultures in the southern United States.
Transmission of typhoid, dysentery, cholera and other
diseases by flies is well established in man. Why not hog-cholera
from farm to farm by flies, English sparrows, pigeons
feeding, or by turkey buzzards? Though this would not
be easy to prove, it seems reasonable.</p>

<p>Preventing contact of such animals with the discharges
or with the carcasses of those dead of the disease, destruction
of insect carriers, screening and prevention of fly breeding
are obvious protective measures.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) In this class come certain diseases for which particular
insects are necessary for the parasite in question, so that
certain stages in its life history may be passed therein. The
surest means for eradicating such diseases is the destruction
of the insects concerned. Up to the present no <em>bacterial</em>
disease is known in which this condition exists, unless Rocky
Mountain spotted fever and typhus fever shall prove to be
due to bacteria. Such diseases are all due to protozoa.
Among them are Texas fever, due to <i class="taxonomy">Piroplasma bigeminum</i>
in this country which has been eradicated in entire districts
by destruction of the cattle tick (<i class="taxonomy">Margaropus annulatus</i>).<!--TN: was .)--></p>

<p>Piroplasmoses in South Africa among cattle and horses,
and in other countries are transmitted in similar ways.
Probably many of the diseases due to spirochetes and trypanosomes
are likewise transmitted by <em>necessary</em> insect intermediaries.
In human medicine the eradication of yellow
fever from Panama and Cuba is due to successful warfare
against, a certain mosquito (<i class="taxonomy">Stegomyia</i>). So the freeing of
large areas in different parts of the world from <i>malaria</i>
follows the destruction of the mosquitoes. The prevention
of typhus fever and of trench fever by “delousing” methods
is familiar from recent army experience though for typhus
this method has been practiced in Russia for more than ten
years to the author’s personal knowledge. The campaign
against disease in animals and man from insect sources
must be considered as still in its infancy. The full utilization
of tropical lands depends largely on the solution of this
problem.</p>

PATHS OF ENTRANCE OF PATHOGENIC
ORGANISMS,

OR

CHANNELS OF INFECTION.</h3>


<p><i>A.</i> <b>The Skin.</b>&mdash;If the skin is healthy there is no opportunity
for bacteria to penetrate it. It is protected not
only by the stratified epithelium, but also in various animals,
by coats of hair, wool, feathers, etc. The secretion pressure
of the healthy sweat and oil glands acts as an effective bar
even to motile bacteria. Nevertheless a very slight injury
only is sufficient to give normal surface parasites and other
pathogenics, accidentally or purposely brought in contact
with it, an opportunity for more rapid growth and even
entrance for general infection. Certain diseases due to
higher fungi are characteristically “skin diseases” and rarely
become general&mdash;various forms of favus, trichophyton infections,
etc. A few disease organisms, tetanus, malignant
edema, usually get in through the skin; others, black-leg,
anthrax, quite commonly; and those diseases transmitted
by biting and blood-sucking insects, piroplasmoses, trypanosomiases,
spirilloses, scarcely in any other way. Defective
secretion in the skin glands from other causes, may permit
lodgment and growth of bacteria in them or in the hair
follicles. “Pimples” and boils in man and local abscesses
occasionally in animals are illustrations. Sharp-edged and
freely bleeding wounds are less liable to be infected than
contusions, ragged wounds, burns, etc. The flowing blood
washes out the wound and the clotting seals it, while there
is less material to be repaired by the leukocytes and they are
free to care for invading organisms (phagocytosis). Pathogenic
<a id="Page_244" class="pagenum" title="244"> </a>
organisms, especially pus cocci, frequently gain lodgment
in the <i>milk glands</i> and cause local (mastitis) or general
infection.</p>

<p><i>B.</i><!--TN: was 'f.'--> <b>Mucosæ directly continuous with the skin and lined
with stratified epithelium</b> are commonly well protected
thereby and by the secretions.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The external auditory meatus is rarely the seat even of
local infection. The tympanic cavity is normally sterile,
though it may become infected by extension through the
Eustachian tube from the pharynx (<i>otitis media</i>).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The conjunctiva is frequently the seat of localized,
very rarely the point of entrance for a generalized infection,
except after severe injury. Those diseases whose path of
entrance is generally assumed to be the respiratory tract
(see “<a href="#LUNGS" class="int-ref">Lungs</a>” below) might also be admitted through the
eye. Material containing such organisms might get on the
conjunctiva and be washed down through the lachrymal
canal into the nose. Experiment has shown that bacteria
may pass in this way in a few minutes. In case masks are
worn to avoid infection from patients suffering with these
diseases, the eyes should therefore be protected as well as
the nose and mouth.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The nasal cavity on account of its anatomical structure
retains pathogenic organisms which give rise to local
infections more frequently than other mucosæ of its character.
These may extend from here to middle ear, neighboring
sinuses, or along the lymph spaces of the olfactory nerve
into the cranial cavity (meningitis). Acute coryza (“colds”
in man) is characteristic. Glanders, occasionally, is primary
in the nose, as is probably roup in chickens, leprosy
in man. The meningococcus and the virus of poliomyelitis
pass from the nose into the cranial cavity without local
lesions in the former.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The mouth cavity is ordinarily protected by its epithelium
and secretions, though the injured mucosa is a
common source of <i class="term">actinomycosis</i> infection, as well as thrush.
In foot-and-mouth disease no visible lesions seem necessary
to permit the localization of the unknown infective agent.</p>

<p><a id="Page_245" class="pagenum" title="245"> </a>
(<i>e</i>) The tonsils afford a ready point of entrance for ever-present
<i>micrococci</i> and <i>streptococci</i> whenever occasion offers
(follicular tonsillitis, “quinsy”), and articular rheumatism is
not an uncommon sequel. The diphtheria bacillus characteristically
seeks these structures for its development.
Tubercle and anthrax organisms occasionally enter here.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) The pharynx is the seat of localized infection as in
<i class="term">micrococcal</i>, <i class="term">streptococcal</i><!--TN: was 'strepococcal'--> and diphtherial “sore throat” in
human beings, but both it and the esophagus are rarely
infected in animals except as the result of injury.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) The external genitalia are the usual points of entrance
for the venereal organisms in man (gonococcus, <i class="taxonomy">Treponema
pallidum</i>, and Ducrey’s bacillus). The bacillus of contagious
abortion and probably the trypanosome of dourine
are commonly introduced through these channels in animals.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> <b id="LUNGS">Lungs.</b>&mdash;The varied types of pneumonia due to many
different organisms (tubercle, glanders, influenza, plague
bacilli, pneumococcus, streptococcus, micrococcus and many
others) show how frequently these organs are the seat of a
localized infection, which may or may not be general.
Whether the lungs are the actual point of entrance in these
cases is a question which is much discussed at the present
time, particularly with reference to tuberculosis. The
mucous secretion of the respiratory tract tends to catch
incoming bacteria and other small particles and the ciliary
movement along bronchial tubes and trachea tends to carry
such material out. “Foreign body pneumonia” shows clinically,
and many observers have shown experimentally that
microörganisms may reach the alveoli even though the
exchange of air between them and the bronchioles and larger
bronchi takes place ordinarily only by diffusion. The presence
of carbon particles in the walls of the alveoli in older
animals and human beings and in those that breathe dusty
air for long periods indicates strongly, though it does not
prove absolutely, that these came in with inspired air. On
the other hand, experiment has shown that tubercle bacilli
introduced into the intestine may appear in the lungs and
cause disease there and not in the intestine. It is probably
safe to assume that in those diseases which are transmitted
<a id="Page_246" class="pagenum" title="246"> </a>
most readily through close association though not necessarily
actual contact, the commonest path is through the
respiratory tract, which may or may not show lesions (smallpox,
scarlet fever, measles, chicken-pox, whooping-cough,
pneumonic plague in man, lobar and bronchopneumonias
and influenza in man and animals, some cases of glanders
and tuberculosis). On the other hand, the fact that the
<i class="taxonomy">Bacterium typhosum</i> and <i class="taxonomy">Bacterium coli</i> may cause pneumonia
when they evidently have reached the lung from the intestinal
tract, and the experimental evidence of lung tuberculosis
above mentioned show that this route cannot be excluded
in inflammations of the lung.</p>

<p><i>D.</i> <b>Alimentary Tract.</b>&mdash;The alimentary tract affords the
ordinary path of entrance for the causal microbes of many
of the diseases of animals and man, since they are carried
into the body most commonly and most abundantly in the
food and drink.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The stomach is rarely the seat of local infection, even
in ruminants, except as the result of trauma. The character
of the epithelium in the rumen, reticulum and omasum in
ruminants, the hydrochloric acid in the abomasum and in
the stomachs of animals generally are usually sufficient protection.
Occasionally anthrax “pustules” develop in the
gastric mucosa. (The author saw nine such pustules in a
case of anthrax in a man.)</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The intestines are frequently the seat of localized
infections, as various “choleras” and “dysenteries” in men
and many animals, anthrax, tuberculosis, Johne’s disease.
Here doubtless enter the organisms causing “hemorrhagic
septicemias” in many classes of animals, and numerous
others. These various organisms must have passed through
the stomach and the question at once arises, why did the
HCl not destroy them? It must be remembered that the
acid is present only during stomach digestion, and that
liquids taken on an “empty stomach” pass through rapidly
and any organisms present are not subjected to the action of
the acid. Also spores generally resist the acid. Other
organisms may pass through the stomach within masses of
undigested food. The fact that digestion is going on in the
<a id="Page_247" class="pagenum" title="247"> </a>
stomach of ruminants practically all the time may explain
the relative freedom of <em>adult</em> animals of this class from
“choleras” and “dysenteries.”</p>


<h4 id="MECHANISM_OF_ENTRANCE_OF_ORGANISMS">MECHANISM OF ENTRANCE OF ORGANISMS.</h4>

<p>In the preceding chapters statements have been made
that “bacteria enter” at various places or they “pass
through” different mucous membranes, skin, etc. Strictly
speaking such statements are incorrect&mdash;bacteria do not
“enter” or “pass through” of themselves. It is true that
some of the intestinal organisms are motile, but most of the
bacteria which are pathogenic are non-motile. Even the
motile ones can not make their way against fluids secreted
or excreted on free surfaces. Bacteria cannot pass by diffusion
through membranes since they are finite particles and
not in solution.</p>

<p>In the case of penetrating wounds bacteria may be carried
mechanically into the tissues, but this is exceptional in most
infections. Also after gaining lodgment they may gradually
grow through by destroying tissue as they grow, but this
is a minor factor. Evidently, there must be some mechanism
by which they <em>are carried</em> through. The known mechanisms
for this in the body are ameboid cells, especially the
phagocytes. It is most probable that these are the chief
agents in getting bacteria into the tissues through various
free surfaces. The phagocytes engulf bacteria, carry them
into the tissues and either destroy them, are destroyed by
them, or may disgorge or excrete them free in the tissues or in
the blood.</p>


<h4 id="DISSEMINATION_OF_ORGANISMS">DISSEMINATION OF ORGANISMS.</h4>

<p>Dissemination of organisms within the tissues occurs either
through the lymph channels or the bloodvessels or both.
If through the lymph vessels only it is usually much more
restricted in extent, or much more slowly disseminated,
while blood dissemination is characterized by the number
of organs involved simultaneously.</p>
<a id="Page_248" class="pagenum" title="248"> </a>


<h4 id="PATHS_OF_ELIMINATION">PATHS OF ELIMINATION OF PATHOGENIC MICROÖRGANISMS.<!--TN: was 'MICRO-ORGANISMS' [split across line]--></h4>

<p>I. Directly from the point, of injury. This is true in
infected wounds open to the surface, skin glanders (farcy),
black-leg, surface anthrax, exanthemata in man and animals
(scarlet fever (?), measles (?), smallpox; hog erysipelas, foot-and-mouth
disease): also in case of disease of mucous membranes
continuous with the skin&mdash;from nasal discharges
(glanders), saliva (foot-and-mouth disease), material coughed
or sneezed out (tuberculosis, influenza, pneumonias), urethral
and vaginal discharges (gonorrhea and syphilis in man,
contagious abortion and dourine in animals), intestinal discharges
(typhoid fever, “choleras,” “dysenteries,” anthrax,
tuberculosis, Johne’s disease). Material from nose, mouth
and lungs may be swallowed and the organisms passed out
through the intestines.</p>

<p>II. Indirectly through the secretions and the excretions
where the internal organs are involved. The <i>saliva</i> of rabid
animals contains the ultramicroscopic virus of rabies (the
sympathetic ganglia within the salivary glands, and pancreas
also, are affected in this disease as well as the cells of
the central nervous system). The <i>gall-bladder</i> in man is
known to harbor colon and typhoid bacilli, as that of hog-cholera
hogs does the virus of this disease. It may harbor
analogous organisms in other animals, though such knowledge
is scanty. The <i>kidneys</i> have been shown experimentally
to excrete certain organisms introduced into the circulation
within a few minutes (micrococci, colon and typhoid
bacilli, anthrax). Typhoid bacilli occur in the urine of
typhoid-fever patients in about 25 per cent. of all cases and
the urine of hogs with hog cholera is highly virulent. Most
observers are of the opinion, however, that under natural
conditions the kidneys do not excrete bacteria unless they
themselves are infected.</p>

<p>The <i>milk</i> both of tuberculous cattle and tuberculous
women has been shown to contain tubercle bacilli <em>even when
the mammary glands are not involved</em>. Doubtless such bacteria
are carried through the walls of the secreting tubules or of
the smaller ducts by phagocytes and are then set free in
the milk.</p>
<a id="Page_249" class="pagenum" title="249"> </a>


<h4 id="SPECIFICITY_OF_LOCATION_OF_INFECTIVE_ORGANISMS">SPECIFICITY OF LOCATION OF INFECTIVE ORGANISMS.</h4>

<p>It is readily apparent that certain disease organisms tend
to locate themselves in definite regions and the question
arises, Is this due to any specific relationship between organism
and tissue or not? Diphtheria in man usually attacks
the tonsils first, gonorrhea and syphilis the external genitals,
tuberculosis the lung, “choleras” the small intestine,
“dysenteries” the large intestine, influenza the lungs. In
these cases the explanation is probably that the points
attacked are the places where the organism is most commonly
carried, with no specific relationship, since all of these organisms
(Asiatic cholera excepted) also produce lesions in other
parts of the body <em>when they reach them</em>. On the other hand,
the virus of hydrophobia attacks nerve cells, leprosy frequently
singles out nerves, glanders bacilli introduced into
the abdominal cavity of a young male guinea-pig cause an
inflammation of the testicle, malarial parasites and piroplasms
attack the red blood corpuscles, etc. In fact, most
<i>pathogenic protozoa</i> are specific in their localization either
in certain tissue cells or in the blood or lymph. In these
cases there is apparently a real chemical relationship, as
there is also between the <i>toxins</i> of bacteria and certain tissue
cells (tetanus toxin and nerve cells). Whether “chemotherapy”
will ever profit from a knowledge of such chemical
relationships remains to be developed. It appears that a
search for these specific chemical substances with the object
of combining poisons with them so that the organisms might
in this way be destroyed, would be a profitable line of research.</p>

IMMUNITY.</h3>


<p>Immunity, as has already been stated, implies such a condition
of the body that pathogenic organisms after they
have been introduced are incapable of manifesting themselves,
and are unable to cause disease. The word has come to
have a more specific meaning than resistance in many instances,
in other cases the terms are used synonymously.
It is the opposite of susceptibility. The term must be understood
always in a relative sense, since no animal is immune
to all pathogenic organisms, and conceivably not entirely
so to anyone, because there is no question that a sufficient
number of bacteria of any kind might be injected into the
circulation to kill an animal, even though it did it purely
mechanically.</p>

<p>Immunity may be considered with reference to a single
individual or to entire divisions of the organic world, with
all grades between. Thus plants are immune to the diseases
affecting animals; invertebrates to vertebrate diseases; cold-blooded
animals to those of warm blood; man is immune
to most of the diseases affecting other mammals; the rat to
anthrax, which affects other rodents and most mammals;
the well-known race of Algerian sheep is likewise immune
to anthrax while other sheep are susceptible; the negro
appears more resistant to yellow fever than the white; some
few individuals in a herd of hogs always escape an epizoötic
of hog cholera, etc.</p>

<p>Immunity within a given species is modified by a number
of factors&mdash;age, state of nutrition, extremes of heat or cold,
fatigue, excesses of any kind, in fact, anything which tends
to lower the “normal healthy tone” of an animal also tends
to lower its resistance. Children appear more susceptible
to scarlet fever, measles, whooping-cough, etc., than adults;
<a id="Page_251" class="pagenum" title="251"> </a>
young cattle more frequently have black-leg than older ones
(these apparently greater susceptibilities may be due in part
to the fact that most of the older individuals have had the
diseases when young and are immune for this reason). Animals
weakened by hunger or thirst succumb to infection
more readily. Frogs and chickens are immune to tetanus,
but if the former be put in water and warmed up to and
kept, at about 37°, and the latter be chilled for several hours
in ice-water, then each may be infected. Pneumonia frequently
follows exposure to cold. The immune rat may be
given anthrax if first he is made to run in a “squirrel cage”
until exhausted. Alcoholics are far less resistant to infection
than temperate individuals. “Worry,” mental anguish,
tend to predispose to infection.</p>

<p>The following outlines summarize the different, classifications
of immunity so far as mammals are concerned for
the purposes of discussion.</p>

</ol>

<p><a id="Page_252" class="pagenum" title="252"> </a>
Immunity present in an animal and not due to human
interference is to be regarded as <em>natural</em> immunity, while if
brought about by man’s effort it is considered <em>artificial</em>.
Those cases of natural immunity mentioned above which
are common to divisions, classes, orders, families, species or
races of organisms and to those few individuals where no
special cause is discoverable, must be regarded as instances
of true <i>inheritance</i> through the germ cell as other characteristics
are. All other kinds of immunity are <em>acquired</em>.
Occasionally young are born with every evidence that they
have had a disease <i>in utero</i> and are thereafter as immune as
though the attack had occurred after birth (“small-pox
babies,” “hog-cholera pigs”). Experiment has shown that
immune substances may pass from the blood of the mother
to the fetus <i>in utero</i> and the young be immune for a time
after birth (tetanus). This is of no practical value as yet.
It is a familiar fact that with most infectious diseases recovery
from one attack confers a more or less lasting immunity,
though there are marked exceptions.</p>

<p><b>Active Immunity.</b>&mdash;By active immunity is meant that
which is due to the actual introduction of the organism, or
in some cases of its products. The term active is used because
the body cells of the animal immunized perform the
real work of bringing about the immunity as will be discussed
later. In <i>passive</i> immunity the blood serum of an
actively immunized animal is introduced into a second animal,
which thereupon becomes immune, though its cells are
not concerned in the process. The animal is <i>passive</i>, just
as a test-tube, in which a reaction takes place, plays no other
part than that of a passive container for the reagents.</p>

<p>In <i>active</i> immunity the organism may be introduced in
what is to be considered a natural manner, as when an animal
becomes infected, has a disease, without human interference.
Or the organism may be purposely introduced to
bring about the immunity. For certain purposes the introduction
of the products of the organism (toxins) is used to
bring about active immunity (preparation of diphtheria and
tetanus antitoxin from the horse). The method of producing
active immunity by the artificial introduction of the
<a id="Page_253" class="pagenum" title="253"> </a>
organism is called <i class="term">vaccination</i>, and a <i class="term">vaccine</i> must therefore
contain the organism. <i class="term">Vaccines</i> for <i>bacterial</i> diseases are
frequently called <i class="term">bacterins</i>. The use of the blood serum of
an immunized animal to confer passive immunity on a
second animal is properly called <i class="term">serum therapy</i>, and the
serum so used is spoken of as an <i class="term">antiserum</i>, though the latter
word is also used to denote any serum containing any kind
of an antibody (<a href="#CHAPTER_XXVII" class="int-ref">Chapters XXVII&ndash;XXXI</a>). In a few instances
both the organism and an antiserum are used to
cause both active and passive immunity (<i class="term">serum-simultaneous
method</i> in immunizing against hog cholera).</p>

<p>In producing active immunity the organism may be introduced
(<i>a</i>) <em>alive and virulent</em>, but in very small doses, or in
combination with an immune serum, as just mentioned for
hog cholera. The introduction of the live virulent organism
alone is done only experimentally as yet, as it is obviously
too dangerous to do in practice, except under the strictest
control (introduction of a <i>single tubercle</i> bacillus, followed
by gradually increasing numbers&mdash;Barber and Webb).
More commonly the organisms are introduced (<i>b</i>) alive but
with their <em>virulence reduced</em> (“attenuated”) in one of several
ways: (1) By passing the organism through another animal
as is the case with <i>smallpox vaccine</i> derived from a calf or
heifer. This method was first introduced by Jenner in
1795 and was the first practical means of preventing disease
by <i>vaccination</i>. This word was used because material was
derived from a cow&mdash;Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vacca</i>. (2) By drying the organism,
as is done in the preparation of the vaccine for the <em>Pasteur
treatment of rabies</em>, where the spinal cords of rabbits are
dried for varying lengths of time&mdash;one to four days, Russian
method, one to three days, German method, longer in this
country. (It is probable that the passage of the “fixed
virus” through the rabbit is as important in this procedure
as the drying, since it is doubtful if the “fixed virus” is
pathogenic for man.) It would be more correct to speak of
this as a <em>preventive vaccination against rabies</em>, since the latter
is one of the few diseases which is not amenable to <i>treatment</i>.
The patient always dies if the disease develops. (3) The
organism may be attenuated by growing at a temperature
<a id="Page_254" class="pagenum" title="254"> </a>
above the normal. This is the method used in preparing
<i>anthrax vaccine</i> as done by Pasteur originally. (4) Instead
of growing at a higher temperature the culture may be
heated in such a way that it is not killed but merely weakened.
<i>Black-leg</i> vaccines are made by this method. (5)
Chemicals are sometimes added to attenuate<!--TN: was 'attentuate'--> the organisms,
as was formerly done in the preparation of black-leg vaccine
by Kruse’s method in Germany. The use of toxin-antitoxin
mixtures in immunizing against diphtheria and in the
preparation of diphtheria antitoxin from horses is an application
of the same principle, though here it is the <em>product</em>
of the organism and not the organism whose action is weakened.
(6) Within the past few years the workers in the Pasteur
Institute in Paris have been experimenting with vaccines
prepared by treating living virulent bacteria with
antisera (“sensitizing them”) so that they are no longer
capable of causing the disease when introduced, but do
cause the production of an active immunity. The method
has been used with typhoid fever bacilli in man and seems
to be successful. It remains to be tried out further before
its worth is demonstrated (the procedure is more complicated
and the chance for infection apparently much greater
than by the use of killed cultures). The term <i class="term">sero-bacterins</i>
is used by manufacturers in this country to designate such
bacterial vaccines. (7) Growing on artificial culture media
reduces the virulence of most organisms after a longer or
shorter time. This method has been tried with many organisms
in the laboratory, but is not now used in practice.
The difficulties are that the attenuation is very uncertain
and that the organisms tend to regain their virulence when
introduced into the body.</p>

<p>In producing active immunity against many bacterial
diseases the organisms are introduced (<i>c</i>) dead. They are
killed by heat or by chemicals, or by using both methods
(<a href="#CHAPTER_XXX" class="int-ref">Chapter XXX</a>).</p>

<p>When the products of an organism are introduced the
resulting immunity is against the products only and not
against the organism. If the organism itself is introduced
there results an immunity against it and in some cases also
<a id="Page_255" class="pagenum" title="255"> </a>
against the products, though the latter does not necessarily
follow. Hence the immunity may be <i>antibacterial</i> or <i>antitoxic</i>
or both.</p>

<p>Investigation as to the causes of immunity and the various
methods by which it is produced has not resulted in the discovery
of specific methods of treatment for as many diseases
as was hoped for at one time. Just at present progress
in serum therapy appears to be at a standstill, though vaccines
are giving good results in many instances not believed
possible a few years ago. As a consequence workers in all
parts of the world are giving more and more attention to
the search for <em>specific chemical substances</em>, which will destroy
invading parasites and not injure the host (<i>chemotherapy</i>).
Nevertheless, in the study of immunity very much of value
in the treatment and prevention of disease has been learned.
Also much knowledge which is of the greatest use in other
lines has been accumulated. Methods of <i>diagnosis</i> of great
exactness have resulted, applicable in numerous diseases.
Ways of <i>detecting adulteration</i> in foods, particularly foods
from animal sources, and of <i>differentiating proteins</i> of varied
origin, as well as means of establishing <i>biological relationships</i>
and differences among groups of animals through
“immunity reactions” of blood serums have followed from
knowledge gained by application of the facts or the methods
of immunity research. Hence the study of “immunity
problems” has come to include much more than merely the
study of those factors which prevent the development of
disease in an animal or result in its spontaneous recovery.
A proper understanding of the principles of immunity necessitates
a study of these various features and they will be
considered in the discussion to follow.</p>

THEORIES OF IMMUNITY.</h3>


<p>Pasteur and the bacteriologists of his time discovered
that bacteria cease to grow in artificial culture media after
a time, because of the exhaustion of the food material in
some cases and because of the injurious action of their own
products in other instances. These facts were brought forward
to explain immunity shortly after bacteria were shown
to be the cause of certain diseases. Theories based on these
observations were called (1) “<i class="term">Exhaustion Theory</i>” of <i>Pasteur</i>,
and (2) “<i>Noxious Retention Theory</i>” of <i>Chauveau</i> respectively.
The fact, soon discovered, that virulent pathogenic
bacteria are not uncommonly present in perfectly healthy
animals, and the later discovery that immunity may be
conferred by the injection of dead bacteria have led to the
abandonment of both these older ideas. The (3) “<i class="term">Unfavorable
Environment</i>” theory of <i>Baumgartner</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, bacteria
do not grow in the body and produce disease because their
surroundings are not suitable, in a sense covers the whole
ground, though it is not true as to the first part, as was
pointed out above, and is of no value as a working basis,
since it offers no explanation as to <em>what the factors are</em> that
constitute the “<i>unfavorable environment</i>.” Metchnikoff
brought forward a rational explanation of immunity with
his (4) “<i>Cellular or Phagocytosis Theory</i>.” As first propounded
it based immunity on the observed fact that certain
white blood corpuscles, <i class="term">phagocytes</i>, engulf and destroy
bacteria. Metchnikoff<!--TN: was 'Metchinkoff'--> has since elaborated the original
theory to explain facts of later discovery. Ehrlich soon after
published his (5) “<i class="term">Chemical or Side-chain Theory</i>” which
seeks to explain immunity on the basis of <i>chemical substances</i>
in the body which may in part destroy pathogenic organisms
or in part neutralize their products; or in some instances
<a id="Page_257" class="pagenum" title="257"> </a>
there may be an absence of certain chemical substances
in the body cells so that bacteria or their products <em>cannot

<p>At the present time it is generally accepted, in this country
at least, that Ehrlich’s theory explains immunity in
many diseases as well as many of the phenomena related to
immunity, and in other diseases the phagocytes, frequently
assisted by chemical substances, are the chief factors. Specific
instances are discussed in <cite>Pathogenic Bacteriologies</cite>
which should be consulted. It is essential that the student
should be familiar with the basic ideas of the chemical theory,
not only from the standpoint of immunity, but also in order
to understand the principles of a number of valuable methods
of diagnosis.</p>

<p>The chemical theory rests on three fundamental physiological
principles: (1) the response of cells to stimuli, in
this connection <em>specific chemical stimuli</em>, (2) the presence
within cells of <em>specific chemical groups</em> which combine with
chemical stimuli and thus enable them to act on the cell,
which groups Ehrlich has named <i class="term">receptors</i>, and (3) the
“<em>over-production</em>” activity of cells as announced by Weigert.</p>

<p>1. That cells respond to stimuli is fundamental in physiology.
These stimuli may be of many kinds as mechanical,
electrical, light, thermal, chemical, etc. The body possesses
groups of cells specially developed to <em>receive</em> some of these
stimuli&mdash;touch cells for mechanical stimuli, retinal cells for
light, temperature nerve endings for thermal, olfactory and
gustatory cells for certain chemical stimuli. <em>Response</em> to
chemical stimuli is well illustrated along the digestive tract.
That the chemical stimuli in digestion may be more or less
specific is shown by the observed differences in the enzymes
of the pancreatic juice dependent on the relative amounts
of carbohydrates, fats, or proteins in the food, the specific
enzyme in each case being increased in the juice with the
increase of its corresponding foodstuff. The cells of the
body, or certain of them at least, seem to respond in a specific
way when substances are brought into direct contact
with them, that is, without having been subjected to digestion
in the alimentary tract, but injected directly into the
<a id="Page_258" class="pagenum" title="258"> </a>
blood or lymph stream. Cells may be affected by stimuli
in one of three ways: if the stimulus is too weak, there is
no effect (in reality there is no “stimulus” acting); if the
stimulus is too strong, the cell is injured, or may be destroyed;
if the stimulus is of proper amount then it excites the cell
to increased activity, and in the case of <em>specific chemical
stimuli</em> the increased activity, as mentioned for the pancreas,
shows itself in an <em>increased production of whatever
is called forth by the chemical stimulus</em>. In the case of many
organic chemicals, the substances produced by the cells
under their direct stimulation are markedly specific for the
particular substance introduced.</p>

<p>2. Since chemical action always implies at least two
bodies to react, Ehrlich assumes that in every cell which is
affected by a chemical stimulus there must therefore be a
chemical group to unite with this stimulus. He further
states that there must be as many different kinds of these
groups as there are different kinds of chemicals which stimulate
the cell. Since these groups are present in the body
cells to <em>take up</em> different kinds of chemical substances,
Ehrlich calls them <i class="term">receptors</i>. Since these groups must be
small as compared with the cell as a whole, and must be
more or less on the surface and unite readily with chemical
substances he further speaks of them as “side-chains” after
the analogy of compounds of the aromatic series especially.
The term <i class="term">receptors</i> is now generally used. As was stated
above, the effect of <em>specific chemical stimuli</em> is to cause the
production of <em>more of the particular substance</em> for which it is
specific and in the class of bodies under discussion, the
<em>particular product is these cell receptors</em> with which the chemical
may unite.</p>

<p>3. Weigert first called attention to the practically constant
phenomenon that cells ordinarily respond by doing
more of a particular response than is actually called for by
the stimulus, that there is always an “overproduction” of
activity. In the case of chemical stimuli this means an
<em>increased production of the specific substance</em> over and above
the amount actually needed.</p>

<p><a id="Page_259" class="pagenum" title="259"> </a>
The student will better understand this theory if he recalls
his fundamental physiology. Living substance is characterized,
among other things, by irritability which is instability.
It is in a constant, state of unstable equilibrium.
Whenever the equilibrium becomes permanently stable the
substance is dead. It is also continually attempting to
restore disturbances in its equilibrium. Whenever a chemical
substance unites with a chemical substance in the cell,
a receptor, the latter is, so far as the cell is concerned,
<em>thrown out of function</em> for that cell. The chemical equilibrium
of the latter is upset. It attempts to restore this
and does so by making a <em>new</em> receptor to take the place
of the one thrown out of function. If this process is continued,
<i>i.e.</i>, if the new receptor is similarly “used up”
and others similarly formed are also, then the cell will prepare
a supply of these and even an excess, according to
Weigert’s theory. Whenever a cell accumulates an excess
of products the normal result is that it excretes them from
its own substance into the surrounding lymph, whence they
reach the blood stream to be either carried to the true
excretory organs, utilized by other cells or remain for a
longer or shorter time in the blood. Hence the excess of
receptors is <em>excreted from the cell that forms them</em> and they
become <em>free</em> in the blood. These free receptors are termed
<i class="term">antibodies</i>. <em>They are receptors</em> but instead of being retained
in the cell are <em>free in solution in the blood</em>. One function
of the free receptor, the antibody, is <em>always to unite with
the chemical substance which caused it to be formed</em>. <em>It may
have additional functions.</em> The chemical substance which
caused the excess formation of receptors, antibodies, is
termed an <i class="term">antigen</i> for that particular kind of antibody.</p>

<p>To recapitulate, Ehrlich’s theory postulates <em>specific chemical
stimuli</em>, which react with <em>specific chemical substances in
the body cells, named receptors</em>, and that these <i>receptors</i>,
according to Weigert, are <em>produced in excess</em> and hence are
excreted from the cell and become <i>free receptors</i> in the blood
and lymph. These <i>free receptors</i> are the various kinds of
<i>antibodies</i>, the kind depending on the nature of the stimulus,
antigen, the substance introduced. Any substance which
<a id="Page_260" class="pagenum" title="260"> </a>
when introduced into the body causes the formation of an
antibody of any kind whatsoever is called an <i class="term">antigen</i>,<a id="Marker_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="marker" title="Footnote 23">23</a> <i>i.e.</i>,
anti (body) former.</p>

<p>The foregoing discussion explains Ehrlich’s theory of immunity.
According to this theory the <em>manner of formation
of all antibodies</em> is the same. The <em>kind of antibody</em> and
the <em>manner of its action</em> will differ with the <em>different kinds
of antigens</em> used.</p>

<p>The succeeding chapters discuss some of the kinds of
antibodies, the theory of their action and some practical
applications. It must be borne in mind throughout the
study of these, as has been stated, that <em>every antibody has
the property of uniting with its antigen whether it has any
property in addition or not</em>.</p>

<p>Just what antibodies are chemically has not been determined
because no one has as yet succeeded in isolating them
chemically pure. To the author they appear to be enzymes.</p>

<p>Antigens were considered by Ehrlich to be proteins or to
be related to proteins. Most workers since Ehrlich have
held similar views. Dr. Carl Warden of the University of
Michigan has been doing much work in recent years in which
he is attempting to show that the antigens are not proteins
but are fats or fatty acids. Mr. E.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;H. Boyer, in his
work (not yet published) in the author’s laboratory for the
degree of Ph.D., received in June, 1920, succeeded in producing
various antibodies from <i class="taxonomy">Bacterium coli</i> antigens. In
these antigens he could detect only fatty acids or salts of
fatty acids. If the work of these men is confirmed, it will
open up a most interesting and extremely important field
in immunity and in preventive medicine. It is not apparent
that the nature of the antigen would affect Ehrlich’s theory
of the formation of antibodies.</p>

<p>The author has no doubt that eventually the formation
of antibodies and the reactions between them and their
antigens will be explained on the basis of physical-chemical
laws, but this probably awaits the discovery of their nature.</p>

RECEPTORS OF THE FIRST ORDER.</h3>


<h4 id="ANTITOXINS_ANTIENZYMES">ANTITOXINS&mdash;ANTIENZYMES.</h4>

<p>The general characteristics of toxins have been described
(<a href="#CHAPTER_XII" class="int-ref">Chapter XII</a>). It has been stated that they are more or
less specific in their action on cells. In order to affect a cell
it is evident that a toxin must enter into chemical combination
with it. This implies that the toxin molecule possesses
a chemical group which can combine with a receptor of the
cell. This group is called the <i class="term">haptophore</i> or combining
group. The toxic or injurious portion of the toxin molecule
is likewise spoken of as the <i class="term">toxophore</i> group. When a toxin
is introduced into the body its <i class="term">haptophore</i> group combines
with suitable <i class="term">receptors</i> in different cells of the body. If not
too much of the toxin is given, instead of injuring, it acts as a
chemical stimulus to the cell in the manner already described.
The cell in response produces more of the specific thing,
which in this instance is more receptors which can combine
with the toxin, <i>i.e.</i>, with its haptophore group. If the stimulus
is kept up, more and more of these receptors are produced
until an excess for the cell accumulates, which excess
is excreted from the individual cell and becomes free in the
blood. These free receptors have, of course, the capacity
to combine with toxin through its haptophore group. When
the toxin is combined with these free receptors, it cannot
combine with any other receptors, <i>e.g.</i>, those in another
cell and hence cannot injure another cell. These free receptors
constitute, in this case, <i class="term">antitoxin</i>, so-called because they
can combine with toxin and hence neutralize it. Antitoxins
are specific&mdash;that is, an antitoxin which will combine
with the toxin of <i class="taxonomy">Clostridium tetani</i> will not combine with
that of <i class="taxonomy">Corynebacterium diphtheriæ</i> or of <i class="taxonomy">Clostridium botulinum</i>,
or of any other toxin, vegetable or animal.</p>

<p><a id="Page_262" class="pagenum" title="262"> </a>
When a toxin is kept in solution for some time or when it
is heated above a certain temperature (different for each
toxin) it loses its poisonous character. It may be shown,
however, that it is still capable of uniting with antitoxin,
and preventing the latter from uniting with a fresh toxin.
This confirms the hypothesis that a toxin molecule has at
least two groups: a combining or <i class="term">haptophore</i>, and a poisoning
or <i class="term">toxophore</i> group. A toxin which has lost its poisonous
property, its toxophore group, is spoken of as a <i class="term">toxoid</i>. The
theory of antitoxin formation is further supported by the
fact that the proper introduction of <i class="term">toxoid</i>, the <i class="term">haptophore</i>
group, and hence the real stimulus, can cause the production
of <i class="term">antitoxin</i> to a certain extent at least.</p>

<p>The close relationship between toxins and enzymes has
already been pointed out. This is still further illustrated
by the fact that when enzymes are properly introduced into
the tissues of an animal there is formed in the animal an
<i class="term">antienzyme</i> specific for the enzyme in question which can
prevent its action. The structure of enzymes, as composed
of a <i class="term">haptophore</i>, or uniting, and a <i class="term">zymophore</i> or <i class="term">digesting</i>
(or other activity) group, is similar to that of toxins, and
<i class="term">enzymoids</i> or enzymes which can combine with the substance
acted on but not affect it further, have been demonstrated.</p>

<p>These free cell receptors, antitoxins or antienzymes, which
are produced in the body by the proper introduction of
toxins or enzymes, respectively, have the function of <em>combining</em>
with these bodies <em>but no other action</em>. As was pointed
out above, this is sufficient to neutralize the toxin or enzyme
and prevent any injurious effect since they can unite with
nothing else. Since these receptors are the simplest type
which has been studied as yet, they are spoken of by Ehrlich
as <i class="term">receptors of the first order</i>. Other antibodies which are
likewise free receptors of the first, order and have the function
of combining only have been prepared and will be
referred to in their proper connection. They are mainly of
theoretical interest.</p>

<p>Ehrlich did a large part of his work on toxins and antitoxins
with <i class="term">ricin</i>, the toxin of the castor-oil bean, <i class="term">abrin</i>,
from the jequirity bean, <i class="term">robin</i> from the locust tree, and with
<a id="Page_263" class="pagenum" title="263"> </a>
the toxins and antitoxins for diphtheria and tetanus. Antitoxins
have been prepared experimentally for a large number
of both animal and vegetable poisons, including a number
for bacterial toxins. The only ones which, as yet, are of
much practical importance are <i class="term">antivenin</i> for snake poison,
(not a true toxin, however, see <a href="#Page_275" class="int-ref">p.&nbsp;275</a>), <i class="term">antipollenin</i> (supposed
to be for the toxin of hay fever) and the antitoxins
for the true bacterial toxins of <i class="taxonomy">Corynebacterium diphtheriæ</i>
and <i class="taxonomy">Clostridium tetani</i>.</p>

<p>The method of preparing antitoxins is essentially the same
in all cases, though differing in minor details. For commercial
purposes large animals are selected, usually horses, so
that the yield of serum may be large. The animals must, of
course, be vigorous, free from all infectious disease. The
first injection given is either a relatively small amount of a
solution of toxin or of a mixture of toxin and antitoxin.
The animal shows more or less reaction, increased temperature,
pulse and respiration and frequently an edema at the
point of injection, unless this is made intravenously. After
several days to a week or more, when the animal has recovered
from the first injection, a second stronger dose is given,
usually with less reaction. Increasingly large doses are
given at proper intervals until the animal may take several
hundred times the amount which would have been fatal if
given at first. The process of immunizing a horse for diphtheria
or tetanus toxin usually takes several months. Variations
in time and in yield of antitoxin are individual and
not predictable in any given case.</p>

<p>After several injections a few hundred cubic centimeters
of blood are withdrawn from the jugular vein and serum
from this is tested for the amount of antitoxin it contains.
When the amount is found sufficiently large (250 “units”
at least for diphtheria per cc.)<a id="Marker_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="marker" title="Footnote 24">24</a> then the maximum amount
of blood is collected from the jugular with sterile trocar and
cannula. The serum from this blood with the addition of an
antiseptic (0.5 per cent. phenol, tricresol, etc.) constitutes
“antidiphtheritic serum” or “antitetanic serum,” etc. All
<a id="Page_264" class="pagenum" title="264"> </a>
sera which are put on the market must conform to definite
standards of strength expressed in “units” as determined
by the U.&nbsp;S. Hygienic Laboratory. In reality a “unit” of
diphtheria antitoxin in the United States is an amount
equivalent to 1&nbsp;cc. of a given solution of a <em>standard</em> diphtheria
<i class="term">antitoxin</i> which is kept at the above-mentioned
laboratory. This statement, of course, gives no definite
idea as to the amount of antitoxin actually in a “unit.”
Specifically stated, a “unit” of antitoxin contains approximately
the amount which would protect a 250 gram guinea-pig
from 100 minimum lethal doses of diphtheria toxin, or
protect 100 guinea-pigs weighing 250 grams each from one
minimum lethal dose each. The minimum lethal dose (M.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;D.)
of diphtheria toxin is the least amount that will kill
a guinea-pig of the size mentioned within four days. Since
toxins on standing change into toxoids to a great extent, the
amount, of antitoxin in a “unit,” though protecting against
100 M.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;D., in reality would protect against about 200
M.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;D. of toxin containing no toxoid.</p>

<p>The official unit for tetanus antitoxin is somewhat different,
since it is standardized against a <i class="term">standard toxin</i> which
is likewise kept at the Hygienic Laboratory. The unit is
defined as “ten times the amount of antitoxin necessary to
protect a 350 g. guinea-pig for 96 hours against the <i>standard
test dose</i>” of the standard toxin. The standard test
dose is 100 M.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;D. of toxin for a 350 g. guinea-pig. To
express it another way, one could say that a “unit” of tetanus
antitoxin would protect one thousand 350 g. guinea-pigs
from 1 M.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;D. each of standard tetanus toxin.</p>

<p>Various methods have been devised for increasing the
amount of antitoxin in 1&nbsp;cc. of solution by precipitating
out portions of the blood-serum proteins and at the same
time concentrating the antitoxin in smaller volume. It is
not considered necessary in a work of this character to enter
into these details nor to discuss the process of standardizing
antitoxin so that the exact amount of “units” per cc. may
be known.</p>

RECEPTORS OF THE SECOND ORDER.</h3>


<h4 id="AGGLUTININS">AGGLUTININS.</h4>

<p>Charrin and Rogers appear to have been the first (1889)
to observe the clumping together of bacteria (<i class="taxonomy">Pseudomonas
pyocyanea</i>) when mixed with the blood serum of an animal
immunized against them. Gruber and Durham (1896) first
used the term “agglutination” in this connection and called
the substance in the blood-serum “agglutinin.” Widal
(1896) showed the importance of the reaction for diagnosis
by testing the blood serum of an infected person against a
known culture (typhoid fever).</p>

<p>It is now a well-known phenomenon that the proper injection
of cells of any kind foreign to a given animal will lead
to the accumulation in the animal’s blood of substances
which will cause a clumping together of the cells used when
suspended in a suitable liquid. The cells settle out of such
suspension much more rapidly than they would otherwise
do. This clumping is spoken of as “agglutination” and the
substances produced in the animal are called “agglutinins.”
If blood cells are injected then “hemagglutinins” result: if
bacterial cells “bacterial agglutinins” for the particular
organism used as “glanders agglutinin” for <i class="taxonomy">Pfeifferella mallei</i>,
“abortion agglutinin” for <i class="taxonomy">Bacterium abortus</i>, “typhoid
agglutinin” for <i class="taxonomy">Bacterium typhosum</i>, etc.</p>

<p>The phenomenon may be observed either under the microscope
or in small test-tubes, that is, either <i class="term">microscopically</i> or
<i class="term">macroscopically</i>.</p>

<p>In this case the cells introduced, or more properly, some
substances within the cells, act as stimuli to the body cells
of the animal injected to cause them to produce more of the
<a id="Page_266" class="pagenum" title="266"> </a>
specific cell receptors which respond to the stimulus. The
substance within the introduced cell which acts as a stimulus
(<i class="term">antigen</i>) to the body cells is called an “<i class="term">agglutinogen</i>.”
That “agglutinogen” is present in the cell has been shown by
injecting animals experimentally with extracts of cells (bacterial
and other cells) and the blood serum of the animal injected
showed the presence of agglutinin for the given cell.
It will be noticed that the receptors which become the free
agglutinins have at least <em>two functions</em>, hence at least <em>two
chemical groups</em>. They must combine with the foreign cells
and also bring about their clumping together, their agglutination.
Hence it can be stated technically that an agglutinin
possesses a <i class="term">haptophore group</i> and an <i class="term">agglutinating
group</i>.</p>

<p>It is probable that the agglutination, the clumping, is a
secondary phenomenon depending on the presence of certain
salts and that the agglutinin acts on its antigen as an enzyme,
possibly a “splitting” enzyme. This is analogous<!--TN: was 'analagous'--> to what
occurs in the curdling of milk by rennet and in the coagulation
of blood. This probability is substantiated by the
fact that suspensions of bacteria may be “agglutinated”
by appropriate strengths of various acids.</p>

<p>The formation of agglutinin in the body for different bacteria
does not as yet appear to be of any special significance
in protecting the animal from the organism, since the bacteria
are not killed, even though they are rendered non-motile,
if of the class provided with flagella, and are clumped
together. The fact that such bodies are formed, however,
is of decided value in the diagnosis of disease, and also in
the identification of unknown bacteria.</p>

<p>In many bacterial diseases, agglutinins for the particular
organism are present in the blood serum of the affected
animal. Consequently if the blood serum of the animal be
mixed with a suspension of the organism supposed to be the
cause of the disease and the latter be agglutinated, one is
justified in considering it the causative agent, provided certain
necessary conditions are fulfilled. In the first place it
must be remembered that the blood of normal animals frequently
contains agglutinins (“normal agglutinins”) for
<a id="Page_267" class="pagenum" title="267"> </a>
many different bacteria when mixed with them in full
strength. Hence the serum must always be diluted with
physiological salt solution (0.85 per cent.). Further, closely
related bacteria may be agglutinated to some extent by the
same serum. It is evident that if they are closely related,
their protoplasm must contain some substances of the same
kind to account for this relationship. Since some of these
substances may be agglutinogens, their introduction into
the animal body will give rise to agglutinins for the related
cells, as well as for the cell introduced. The agglutinins
for the cell introduced “chief agglutinins,” will be formed
in larger quantity, since a given bacterial cell must contain
more of its own agglutinogen than that of any other cell. By
<em>diluting the blood serum</em> from the animal to be tested the
agglutinins for the related organisms (so-called “coagglutinins”
or “partial agglutinins”) will become so much
diminished as to show no action, while the agglutinin for
the specific organism is still present in an amount sufficient
to cause its clumping. <em>Agglutinins are specific for their
particular agglutinogens</em>, but since a given blood serum may
contain many agglutinins, the <em>serum’s specificity for a given
bacterium</em> can be determined only by diluting it until this
bacterium alone is agglutinated. Hence the necessity of
diluting the unknown serum in varying amounts when testing
against several known bacteria to determine for which
it is specific, <i>i.e.</i>, which is the cause of the disease in the
animal.</p>

<p>The agglutinins in the serum may be removed from it
by treating it with a suspension of the cells for which agglutinins
are present. If the “chief” cell is used all the agglutinins
will be absorbed. If related cells are used, only the
agglutinins for this particular kind are removed. These
“absorption tests” furnish another means of determining
specificity of serum, or rather of determining the “chief
agglutinin” present.</p>

<p>Just as an unidentified <em>disease</em> in an animal may be determined
by testing its serum as above described against <em>known</em>
kinds of bacteria, so <em>unknown bacteria</em> isolated from an
animal, from water, etc., may be identified by testing them
<a id="Page_268" class="pagenum" title="268"> </a>
against the <i>blood sera</i> of different animals, each of which has
been properly inoculated with a different kind of <em>known
bacteria</em>. If the unknown organism is agglutinated by the
blood of one of the animals in high dilution, and not by the
others, evidently the bacterium is the same as that with
which the animal has been inoculated, or <i class="term">immunized</i>, as is
usually stated. This method of identifying cultures of bacteria
is of wide application, but is used practically only in
those cases where other methods of identification are not
readily applied, and especially where other methods are
<em>not sufficient</em> as in the “intestinal group” of organisms in
human practice.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of disease in an animal by testing its serum
is also a valuable and much used procedure. This is the
method of the “Widal” or “Gruber-Widal” test for typhoid
fever in man and is used in veterinary practice in testing
for glanders, contagious abortion, etc. In some cases a dilution
of the serum of from 20 to 50 times is sufficient for
diagnosis (Malta fever), in most cases, however, 50 times
is the lowest limit. Evidently the greater the dilution, that
is, the higher the “titer,” the more specific is the reaction.</p>


<h4 id="PRECIPITINS">PRECIPITINS.</h4>

<p>Since agglutinins act on bacteria, probably through the
presence of substances within the bacterial cell, it is reasonable
to expect that if these substances be dissolved out of the
cell, there would be some reaction between their (colloidal)
solution and the same serum. As a matter of fact Kraus
(1897) showed that broth cultures freed from bacteria by
porcelain filters do show a precipitate when mixed with the
serum of an animal immunized against the particular bacterium
and that the reaction is specific under proper conditions
of dilution. It was not long after Kraus’s work until
the experiments were tried of “immunizing” an animal not
against a bacterium or its filtered culture, but against
(colloidal) solutions of proteins, such as white of egg, casein
of milk, proteins of meat and of blood serum, vegetable
proteins, etc. It was ascertained that in all these cases the
animal’s serum contains a substance which causes a <i class="term">precipitate</i>
<a id="Page_269" class="pagenum" title="269"> </a>
with solutions of the protein used for immunization.
The number of such precipitating serums that have been
made experimentally is very large and it appears that protein
from any source when properly introduced into the
blood or tissues of an animal will cause the formation of a
precipitating substance for its solutions. This substance is
known, technically as a “<i class="term">precipitin</i>.” The protein used as
antigen to stimulate its formation, or some part of the protein
molecule (haptophore group), which acts as stimulus
to the cell is spoken of as a “precipitinogen,” both terms
after the analogy of “agglutinin” and “agglutinogen.”
In fact the specific precipitation and agglutination are strictly
analogous phenomena. Precipitins act on proteins in
(colloidal) <i class="term">solution</i> and cause them to settle out, agglutinins
act on substances within cells which cells are in <i class="term">suspension</i>
in a fluid and cause the cells to settle out. Ehrlich’s theory
of the formation of precipitins is similar to that of agglutinins,
and need not be repeated. Substitute the corresponding
words in the theory of formation of agglutinins as above
given and the theory applies.</p>

<p>The precipitin reaction has not found much practical use
in bacteriology largely because the “agglutination test”
takes its place as simpler of performance and just as accurate.
The reaction is, however, generally applicable to
filtrates of bacterial cultures and could be used if needed.
The so-called “mallease” reaction in glanders is an instance.</p>

<p>Precipitins find their greatest usefulness in legal medicine
and in food adulteration work. As was noted above,
if animals, rabbits for example, are immunized with the
blood of another animal (human beings) precipitins are
developed which are specific for the injected blood with
proper dilution. This forms an extremely valuable means
of determining the <em>kind of blood</em> present in a given spot
shown by chemical and spectroscopic tests to be blood and
has been adopted as a legal test in countries where such rules
of procedure are applied. Similarly the test has been used
to identify the different kinds of meat in sausage, and different
kinds of milk in a mixture. An extract of the sausage
is made and tested against the serum of an animal
<a id="Page_270" class="pagenum" title="270"> </a>
previously treated with extract of horse meat, or hog meat,
or beef, etc., the specific precipitate occurring with the
specific serum. Such reactions have been obtained where
the protein to be tested was diluted 100,000 times and more.
Biological relationships and differences have been detected
by the reaction. Human immune serum shows no reaction
with the blood of any animals except to a slight extent with
that of various monkeys, most with the higher, very slight
with the lower Old World and scarcely any with New World
monkeys.</p>

<p>It is a fact of theoretical interest mainly that if agglutinins
and precipitins themselves be injected into an animal they
will act as <i class="term">antigens</i> and cause the formation of <i class="term">antiagglutinins</i>
or <i class="term">antiprecipitins</i>, which are therefore receptors of
the first order since they simply combine with these immune
bodies to neutralize their action, have only a combining or
haptophore group. Also if agglutinins or precipitins be
heated to the proper temperature they may retain their
combining power but cause no agglutination or precipitation,
<i>i.e.</i>, they are converted into agglutinoid or precipitinoid
respectively after the analogy of toxin and toxoid.</p>

<p>Precipitins like agglutinins possess at least two groups&mdash;a
combining or <i class="term">haptophore</i> group and a <i class="term">precipitating</i> (sometimes
called zymophore) group. Hence they are somewhat
more complex than antitoxins or antienzymes which have
a combining group only. For this reason Ehrlich classes
agglutinins and precipitins as <i>receptors of the second order</i>.</p>

RECEPTORS OF THE THIRD ORDER.</h3>


<h4 id="CYTOLYSINS">CYTOLYSINS.</h4>

<p>Before Koch definitely proved bacteria capable of causing
disease several physiologists had noted that the red corpuscles
of certain animals were destroyed by the blood of
other animals (Creite, 1869, Landois, 1875), and Traube and
Gescheidel had shown that freshly drawn blood destroys
bacteria (1874). It was not until about ten years afterward
that this action of the blood began to be investigated in
connection with the subject of immunity. Von Fodor
(1885) showed that saprophytic bacteria injected into the
blood are rapidly destroyed. Flügge and his pupils, especially
Nuttall in combating Metchnikoff’s theory of phagocytosis,
announced in 1883, studied the action of the blood
on bacteria and showed its destructive effect (1885&ndash;57).
Nuttall also showed that the blood lost this power if heated
to 56°. Buchner (1889) gave the name “alexin” (from the
Greek “to ward off”) to the destroying substance and showed
that the substance was present in the <i class="term">blood serum</i> as well as
in the whole blood, and that when the serum lost its power
to dissolve, this could be restored by adding fresh blood.
Pfeiffer (1894) showed that the destructive power of the
blood of animals immunized against bacteria (cholera and
typhoid) was markedly specific for the bacteria used. He
introduced a mixture of the blood and the bacteria into the
abdominal cavity of the immunized animal or of a normal
one of the same species and noted the rapid solution of the
bacteria by withdrawing portions of the peritoneal fluid and
examining them (“Pfeiffer’s phenomenon”). Belfanti and
Carbone and especially Bordet (1898) showed the specific
dissolving action of the serum of one animal on the blood
corpuscles of another animal with which it had been injected.
<a id="Page_272" class="pagenum" title="272"> </a>
Since this time the phenomenon has been observed with a
great variety of cells other than red blood corpuscles and
bacteria&mdash;leukocytes, spermatozoa, cells from liver, kidney,
brain, epithelia, etc., protozoa, and many vegetable cells.</p>

<p>It is therefore a well-established fact that the proper
injection of an animal with almost any cell foreign to it
will lead to the blood of the animal injected acquiring the
power to injure or destroy cells of the same kind as those
introduced. The destroying power of the blood has been
variously called its “cytotoxic” or “cytolytic” power,
though the terms are not strictly synonymous since “cytotoxic”
means “cell poisoning” or “injuring,” while “cytolytic”
means “cell dissolving.” The latter term is the one
generally used and there is said to be present in the blood a
specific “cytolysin.” The term is a general one and a given
cytolysin is named from the cell which is dissolved, as a
<i class="term">bacteriolysin</i>, a <i class="term">hemolysin</i> (red-corpuscle-lysin), <i class="term">epitheliolysin</i>,
<i class="term">nephrolysin</i> (for kidney cells), etc. If the cell is <em>killed</em> but
not <em>dissolved</em> the suffix “cidin” or “toxin” is frequently used
as “bacteriocidin,” “spermotoxin,” “neurotoxin,” etc.</p>

<p>The use of the term “cytolysin” is also not strictly correct,
though convenient, for the process is more complex
than if <em>one substance only</em> were employed. As was stated
above, the immune serum loses its power to dissolve the cell
if it is heated to 55° to 56° for half an hour, it is <i>inactivated</i>.
But if there be added to the heated or inactivated serum a
small amount of <i class="term">normal serum</i> (which contains only a very
little cytolytic substance, so that it has no dissolving power
when so diluted) the mixture again becomes cytolytic.
It is evident then that in cytolysis there are <em>two distinct
substances</em> involved, one which is <em>present in all serum, normal
or immune</em>, and the other <em>present only in the immune cytolytic</em>
serum. This may be more apparent if the facts are arranged
in the following form:</p>

<ol class="list">
  <li>I. Immune serum dissolves cells in high dilution.</li>

  <li>II. Heated immune serum does not dissolve cells.</li>

  <li>III. Normal serum in high dilution does not dissolve cells.</li>

  <li>II. + III., <i>i.e.</i>, Heated immune serum plus diluted normal
  serum dissolves cells.</li>
</ol>

<p class="continued"><a id="Page_273" class="pagenum" title="273"> </a>
Therefore, there is something in heated immune serum necessary
for cell dissolving and something different in diluted
normal serum which is necessary. This latter something is
present in unheated immune serum also, and is destroyed
by heat. Experiment has shown that it is the substance
present in all serum both normal and immune that is the
true dissolving body, while the immune substance serves to
unite this body to the cell to be destroyed, <i>i.e.</i>, to the antigen.
Since the immune body has therefore <em>two uniting
groups</em>, one for the dissolving substance and one for the cell
to be dissolved, Ehrlich calls it the “<i class="term">amboceptor</i>.” He also
uses the word “<i class="term">complement</i>” to denote the dissolving substance,
giving the idea that it completes the action of dissolving
after it has been united to the cell by the amboceptor,
thus replacing Buchner’s older term “alexin” for the same
dissolving body.</p>


<h4 id="AMBOCEPTORS">AMBOCEPTORS.</h4>

<p>The theory of formation of amboceptors is similar to that
for the formation of the other types of antibodies. The
cell introduced contains some substance, which acts as a
chemical stimulus to some of the body cells provided with
proper receptors so that more of these special receptors are
produced, and eventually in excess so that they become free
in the blood and constitute the free amboceptors. It will
be noticed that these free receptors differ from either of the
two kinds already described in that they have <em>two uniting
groups</em>, one for the antigen (cell introduced) named <i class="term">cytophil-haptophore</i>,
the other for the complement, <i class="term">complementophil
haptophore</i>. Hence amboceptors are spoken of as <i class="term">receptors
of the third order</i>. They have no other function than that
of this double combining power. The action which results
is due to the third body&mdash;the complement. It will be readily
seen that complement must possess at least two groups, a
combining or <i class="term">haptophore group</i> which unites with the amboceptor,
and an active group which is usually called the <i class="term">zymophore</i>
or <i class="term">toxophore</i> group. Complements thus resemble
either toxins, where the specific cell (antigen) is injured or
<a id="Page_274" class="pagenum" title="274"> </a>
killed, or enzymes, in case the cell is likewise dissolved.
This action again shows the close relation between toxins
and enzymes. Complement may lose its active group in the
same way that toxin does and becomes then <i class="term">complementoid</i>.
Complement is readily destroyed in blood or serum by
heating it to 55° to 56° for half an hour, and is also destroyed
spontaneously when serum stands for a day or two, less
rapidly at low temperature than at room temperature.</p>

<p>Amboceptors appear to be <em>specific</em> in the same sense that
agglutinins are. That is, if a given cell is used to immunize
an animal, the animal’s blood will contain amboceptors for
the cell used and also for others closely related to it. Immunization
with spermatozoa or with epithelial or liver cells
gives rise to amboceptors for these cells and also for red blood
corpuscles and other body cells. A typhoid bactericidal
serum has also some dissolving effect on colon bacilli, etc.
Hence a given serum may contain a chief amboceptor and a
variety of “coamboceptors,” or one amboceptor made up
of a number of “partial amboceptors” each specific for its
own antigen (“amboceptorogen”). Amboceptors may combine
with other substances than antigen and complement, as
is shown by their union with lecithin and other “lipoids,”
though these substances seem capable of acting as complement
in causing solution of blood corpuscles.</p>


<h4 id="COMPLEMENTS">COMPLEMENTS.</h4>

<p>As to whether complements are numerous, as Ehrlich
claims, or there is only one complement, according to Buchner
and others, need not be discussed here. In the practical
applications given later as means of diagnosis it is apparent
that all the complement or complements are capable of
uniting with at least two kinds of amboceptors.</p>

<p>If complement be injected into an animal it may act as
an antigen and give rise to the formation of <i class="term">anticomplement</i>
which may combine with it and prevent its action and is
consequently analogous to antitoxin. If amboceptors as
antigen are injected into an animal there will be formed by
<a id="Page_275" class="pagenum" title="275"> </a>
the animal’s cells <i class="term">antiamboceptors</i>. As one would expect,
there are two kinds of antiamboceptors, one for each of its
combining groups, since it has been stated that it is always
the combining group of any given antigen that acts as the
cell stimulus. Hence we may have an “anticytophil amboceptor”
or an “anticomplementophil amboceptor.” These
antiamboceptors and the anticomplements are analogous to
antitoxin, antiagglutinin, etc., and hence are receptors of
the first order.</p>


<h4 id="ANTISNAKE_VENOMS">ANTISNAKE VENOMS.</h4>

<p>A practical use of antiamboceptors is in antisnake venoms.
Snake poisons appear to contain only <i class="term">amboceptors</i> for different
cells of the body. In the most deadly the amboceptor
is specific for nerve cells (cobra), in others for red corpuscles,
or for endothelial cells of the bloodvessels (rattlesnake).
The complement is furnished by the blood of the individual
bitten, that is, in a sense the individual poisons himself,
since he furnishes the destroying element. The antisera
contain antiamboceptors which unite with the amboceptor
introduced and prevent it joining to cells and thus binding
the complement to the cells and destroying them. With
this exception these antibodies are chiefly of theoretical
interest.</p>


<h4 id="FAILURE_OF_CYTOLYTIC_SERUMS">FAILURE OF CYTOLYTIC SERUMS.</h4>

<p>The discovery of the possibility of producing a strongly
bactericidal serum in the manner above described aroused
the hope that such sera would prove of great value in passive
immunization and serum treatment of bacterial diseases.
Unfortunately such expectations have not been realized and
no serum of this character of much practical importance has
been developed as yet (with the possible exception of Flexner’s
antimeningococcus serum in human practice. What
hog cholera serum is remains to be discovered).</p>

<p>The reasons for the failure of such sera are not entirely
clear. The following are some that have been offered: (1)
<a id="Page_276" class="pagenum" title="276"> </a>
Amboceptors do not appear to be present in very large
amount so that relatively large injections of blood are necessary,
which is not without risk in itself. (2) Since the complement
is furnished by the blood of the animal to be treated,
there may not be enough of this to unite with a sufficient
quantity of amboceptor to destroy all the bacteria present,
hence the disease is continued by those that escape. (3) Or
the complement may not be of the right kind to unite with
the amboceptor introduced, since this is derived from the
blood of a <i class="term">heterologous</i> (“other kind”) species. In hog-cholera
serum, if it is bactericidal, this difficulty is removed
by using blood of a <i class="term">homologous</i> (“same kind”) animal.
Hence Ehrlich suggested the use of apes for preparing bactericidal
sera for human beings. The good results which
have been reported in the treatment of human beings with
the serum of persons convalescing from the same disease
indicate that this lack of proper complement for the given
amboceptor is probably a chief factor in the failure of sera
from lower animals. (4) The bacteria may be localized in
tissues (lymph glands), within cavities (cranial, peritoneal),
in hollow organs (alimentary tract), etc., so that it is not
possible to get at them with sufficient serum to destroy all.
This difficulty is obviated by injecting directly into the
spinal canal when Flexner’s antimeningococcus serum is
used. (5) Even if the bacteria are dissolved it does not
necessarily follow that their <i class="term">endotoxins</i> are destroyed.
These may be merely liberated and add to the danger of the
patient, though this does not appear to be a valid objection.
(6) Complement which is present in such a large excess
of amboceptor may just as well unite with amboceptor
which is not united to the bacteria to be destroyed as with
that which is, and hence be actually prevented from dissolving
the bacteria. Therefore it is difficult to standardize the
serum to get a proper amount of amboceptor for the complement
present.</p>


<h4 id="COMPLEMENT_FIXATION_TEST">COMPLEMENT-FIXATION TEST.</h4>

<p>Although little practical use has been made of bactericidal
sera, the discovery of receptors of this class and the peculiar
<a id="Page_277" class="pagenum" title="277"> </a>
relations between the antigen, amboceptor and complement
have resulted in developing one of the most delicate and
accurate methods for the diagnosis of disease and for the
recognition of small amounts of specific protein that is in use
today.</p>

<p>This method is usually spoken of as the “complement-fixation”
or the “complement-deviation test” (“Wassermann
test” in syphilis) and is applicable in a great variety
of microbial diseases, but it is of practical importance in
those diseases only where other methods are uncertain&mdash;syphilis
in man, concealed glanders in horses, contagious
abortion in cattle, etc. A better name would be the “Unknown
Amboceptor Test” since it is the amboceptor that
is searched for in the test by making use of its power to
“fix” complement.</p>

<p>The principle is the same in all cases. The method
depends, as indicated above, on the ability of complement
to combine with at least two amboceptor-antigen systems,
and on the further fact that if the combination with one
amboceptor-antigen system is once formed, it does not dissociate
so as to liberate the complement for union with the
second amboceptor-antigen system. If an animal is infected
with a microörganism and a part of its defensive
action consists in destroying the organisms in its blood or
lymph, then it follows from the above discussion of cytolysins
that there will be developed in the blood of the animal
amboceptor specific for the organism in question. If the
presence of this <i class="term">specific amboceptor</i> can be detected, the
conclusion is warranted that the organism for which it is
specific is the cause of the disease. Consequently what is
sought in the “complement-fixation test” is a <i class="term">specific amboceptor</i>.
In carrying out the test, blood serum from the suspected
animal is collected, heated at 56° for half an hour to
destroy any complement it contains and mixed in definite
proportions with the specific antigen and with complement.
The antigen is an extract of a diseased organ (syphilitic
fetal liver, in syphilis), a suspension of the known bacteria,
or an extract of these bacteria. Complement is usually
derived from a guinea-pig, since the serum of this animal is
<a id="Page_278" class="pagenum" title="278"> </a>
higher in complement than that of most animals. The
blood of the gray rat contains practically as much. If the
specific amboceptor is present, that is, if the animal is infected
with the suspected disease, the complement will unite
with the antigen-amboceptor system and be “fixed,” that is,
be no longer capable of uniting with any other amboceptor-antigen
system. No chemical or physical means of telling
whether this union has occurred or not, except as given
below, has been discovered as yet, though doubtless will be
by physico-chemical tests, nor can the combination be seen.
Hence an “indicator,” as is so frequently used in chemistry,
is put into the mixture of antigen-amboceptor-complement
after it has been allowed to stand in the incubator for one-half
to one hour to permit the union to become complete.
The “indicator” used is a mixture of sheep’s corpuscles and
the heated (“inactivated”) blood serum of a rabbit which
has been injected with sheep’s blood corpuscles and therefore
contains a <i class="term">hemolytic amboceptor specific</i> for the corpuscles
which is capable also of uniting with complement. The
indicator is put into the first mixture and the whole is again
incubated and examined. If the mixture is <em>clear</em> and <em>colorless</em>
with a <em>deposit of red corpuscles</em> at the bottom, that
would mean that the complement had been bound to the
first complex, since it was not free to unite with the second
sheep’s corpuscles (antigen)&mdash;rabbit serum (hemolytic amboceptor)
complex&mdash;and destroy the corpuscles. Hence if
the complement is bound in the first instance, the <i>specific
amboceptor</i> for the first antigen must have been present
in the blood, that is, the animal was infected with the organism
in question. Such a reaction is called a “positive”
test.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the final solution is <em>clear</em> but of a <em>red</em>
color, that would mean that complement must have united
with the corpuscles&mdash;hemolytic amboceptor system&mdash;and
destroyed the corpuscles in order to cause the <em>clear red</em>
solution of hemoglobin. If complement united with this
system it could not have united with the first system, hence
there was no <i>specific amboceptor</i> there to bind it; no specific
amboceptor in the animal’s blood, means no infection.
Hence a <i>red solution</i> is a “negative test.”</p>

<p><a id="Page_279" class="pagenum" title="279"> </a>
The scheme for the test may be outlined as follows:</p>

<table class="scheme" summary="">
  <tr>
    <td>Antigen (specific for the amboceptor sought)</td>
    <td class="center">+</td>
    <td>Patient’s Serum, heated (unknown amboceptor)</td>
    <td class="center">+</td>
    <td>Complement (derived from guinea pig’s serum)</td>
  </tr>

<p>Incubate one-half hour in a water bath or one hour in an
incubator.</p>

<p>Then add the indicator which is</p>

    a rabbit immunized against
    the red corpuscles)</td>

</table>

<p>Incubate as above.</p>

<p>In practice all the different ingredients must be accurately
tested, standardized and used in exact quantities, and
tests must also be run as controls with a known normal
blood of an animal of the same species as the one examined
and with a known positive blood.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It should be stated that in one variety of the Complement Fixation Test,
namely, the “Wassermann Test for Syphilis” in human beings, an antigen
is used which is not derived from the specific organism (<i class="taxonomy">Treponema pallidum</i>)
which causes the disease nor even from syphilitic tissue. It has been determined
that alcohol will extract from certain tissues, <em>human or animal</em>, substances
which <em>act specifically</em> in combining with the syphilitic amboceptor
present in the blood. Alcoholic extracts of beef heart are most commonly
used. Details of this test may be learned in the advanced course in Immunity
and Serum Therapy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The complement-fixation test might be applied to the
determination of unknown bacteria, using the unknown culture
as antigen and trying it with the sera of different animals
immunized against a variety of organisms, some one
of which might prove to furnish <i>specific amboceptor</i> for the
unknown organism and hence indicate what it is. The test
used in this way has not been shown to be a practical necessity
and hence is rarely employed. It has been used, however,
to detect traces of unknown proteins, particularly
blood-serum proteins, in medico-legal cases in exactly the
above outlined manner and is very delicate and accurate.</p>

PHAGOCYTOSIS&mdash;OPSONINS.</h3>


<p>It has been mentioned that Metchnikoff, in a publication
in 1883, attempted to explain immunity on a purely cellular
basis. It has been known since Haeckel’s first observation
in 1858 that certain of the white corpuscles do engulf solid
particles that may get into the body, and among them bacteria.
Metchnikoff at first thought that this engulfing and
subsequent intracellular digestion of the microörganisms
were sufficient to protect the body from infection. The
later discoveries (discussed in considering Ehrlich’s theory
of immunity) of substances present in the blood serum and
even in the blood plasma which either destroy the bacteria
or neutralize their action have caused Metchnikoff to modify
his theory to a great extent. He admitted the presence of
these substances, though giving them other names, but ascribed<!--TN: was 'asscribed'-->
their formation to the phagocytes or to the same
organs which form the leukocytes&mdash;lymphoid tissue generally,
bone marrow. It is not within the province of this
work to attempt to reconcile these theories, but it may be
well to point out that Ehrlich’s theory is one of <em>chemical
substances</em> and that the <em>origin</em> of these substances is not an
<em>essential</em> part of the theory, so that the two theories, except
in some minor details, are not necessarily mutually exclusive.</p>

</div>

<p>Sir A.&nbsp;E. Wright and Douglas, in 1903, showed that even
in those instances where immunity depends on phagocytosis,
as it certainly does in many cases, the phagocytes are more
or less inactive unless they are aided by chemical substances
present in the blood. These substances <em>act on the bacteria,
not on the leukocytes</em>, and change them in such a way that
they are more readily taken up by the phagocytes. Wright
<a id="Page_281" class="pagenum" title="281"> </a>
proposed for these bodies the name <i class="term">opsonin</i>, derived from a
Greek word signifying “to prepare a meal for.” Neufeld
and Rimpau at about the same time (1904), in studying
immune sera, observed substances of similar action in these
sera and proposed the name <i class="term">bacteriotropins</i>, or bacteriotropic
substances. There is scarcely a doubt that the two names
are applied to identical substances and that Wright’s name
<i class="term">opsonin</i> should have preference.</p>

<p>The chemical nature of opsonins is not certainly determined,
but they appear to be a distinct class of antibodies
and to possess two groups, a combining or haptophore and
a preparing or opsonic group and hence are similar to antibodies
of Ehrlich’s second order&mdash;agglutinins and precipitins.
Wright also showed that opsonins are just as specific
as agglutinins are&mdash;that is, a micrococcus opsonin prepares
micrococci only for phagocytosis and not streptococci or any
other bacteria.</p>

<p>Wright showed that opsonins for many bacteria are present
in normal serum and that in the serum of an animal
which has been immunized against such bacteria the opsonins
are <em>increased</em> in amount. Also that in a person infected
with certain bacteria the opsonins are either increased or
diminished, depending on whether the progress of the infection
is favorable or unfavorable. The <i class="term">opsonic power</i> of a
serum normal or otherwise is determined by mixing an
emulsion of fresh leukocytes in normal saline solution with
a suspension of the bacteria and with the serum to be tested.
The leukocytes must first be washed in several changes of
normal salt solution to free them from any adherent plasma
or serum. The mixture is incubated for about fifteen minutes
and then slides are made, stained with a good differential
blood stain, Wright’s or other, and the average number
of bacteria taken up by at least fifty phagocytes taken
in order in a field is determined by counting under the
microscope. The number so obtained Wright calls the
<i class="term">phagocytic index</i> of the serum tested. The phagocytic index
of a given serum divided by the phagocytic index of a
normal serum gives the <i class="term">opsonic index</i> of the serum tested.
Assuming the normal opsonic index to be 1, Wright asserts
<a id="Page_282" class="pagenum" title="282"> </a>
that in healthy individuals the range should be not more
than from 0.8 to 1.2, and that an index below 0.8 may show
a great susceptibility for the organism tested, infection with
the given organism if derived from the individual, or improper
dosage in case attempts have been made to immunize
by using killed cultures, vaccines, of the organism.</p>

<p>On the occasion of the author’s visit to Wright’s clinic
(1911) he stated that he used the determination of the
<i class="term">opsonic index</i> chiefly as a <i>guide to the dosage</i> in the use of
vaccines.</p>

<p>Most workers outside the Wright school have failed to
recognize any essential value of determinations of the
opsonic index in the use of vaccines. Some of the reasons
for this are as follows: The limit of error in phagocytic
counts may be as great as 50 per cent. in different series of
fifty, hence several hundred must be counted, which adds
greatly to the tediousness and time involved; the variation
in apparently healthy individuals is frequently great, hence
the “normal” is too uncertain; finally the opsonic index
and the clinical course of the disease do not by any means
run parallel. Undoubtedly the method has decided value
in the hands of an individual who makes opsonic determinations
his chief work, as Wright’s assistants do, but it can
scarcely be maintained at the present time that such determinations
are necessary in vaccine therapy. Nevertheless
that opsonins actually exist and that they play an essential
part in phagocytosis, and hence in immunity, is now generally
recognized.</p>


<h4 id="BACTERIAL_VACCINES">BACTERIAL VACCINES.</h4>

<p>Whether determinations of opsonic index are useful or
not is largely a matter of individual opinion, but there is
scarcely room to doubt that Wright has conferred a lasting
benefit by his revival of the use of <i>dead cultures of bacteria</i>,
<i>bacterial vaccines</i>, both for protective inoculation and for
treatment. It is perhaps better to use the older terms
“vaccination” and “vaccine” (though the cow, <i>vacca</i>, is not
concerned) than to use Wright’s term “opsonic method” in
<a id="Page_283" class="pagenum" title="283"> </a>
this connection, bearing in mind that the idea of a vaccine
is that it contains the <i>causative organism</i> of the infection as
indicated on <a href="#Page_253" class="int-ref">p.&nbsp;253</a>.</p>

<p>As early as 1880 Touissant proposed the use of dead cultures
of bacteria to produce immunity. But because injections
of such cultures were so frequently followed by abscess
formation, doubtless due to the <i>high temperatures</i> used to
kill the bacteria, the method was abandoned. Further, Pasteur
and the French school persistently denied the possibility
of success with such a procedure, and some of them
even maintain this attitude at the present time. The successes
of Wright and the English school which are being
repeated so generally wherever properly attempted, leave
no doubt in the unprejudiced of the very great value of the
method and have unquestionably opened a most promising
field both for preventive inoculation and for treatment in
many infectious diseases. That the practice is no more
universally applicable than are immune serums and that it
has been and is still being grossly overexploited is undoubted.</p>

<p>The use of a vaccine is based on two fundamental principles.
The first of these is that the cell introduced must
not be in a condition to cause serious injury to the animal by
its multiplication and consequent elaboration of injurious
substances. The second is that, on the other hand, it must
contain antigens in such condition that they will act as
stimuli to the body cells to produce the necessary antibodies,
whether these be opsonins, bactericidal substances, or anti-endotoxins.
In the introduction of living organisms there
is always more or less risk of the organism not being sufficiently
attenuated and hence of the possibility of its producing
too severe an infection. In using killed cultures,
great care must be exercised in destroying the organisms,
<i>so that the antigens are not at the same time rendered inactive</i>.
Hence in the preparation of bacterial vaccines by Wright’s
method the <em>temperature and the length of time used to kill the
bacteria are most important factors</em>. This method is in general
to grow the organisms on an agar medium, rub off the
culture and emulsify in sterile normal salt solution (0.85
<a id="Page_284" class="pagenum" title="284"> </a>
per cent. NaCl). The number of bacteria per cc. is determined
by staining a slide made from a small volume of the
emulsion mixed with an equal volume of human blood drawn
from the finger and counting the relative number of bacteria
and of red blood corpuscles. Since the corpuscles are
normally 5,000,000 per c.mm., a simple calculation gives
the number of bacteria. The emulsion of bacteria is then
diluted so that a certain number of millions shall be contained
in each cc., “standardized” as it is called, then heated to
the proper temperature for the necessary time and it is
ready for use. A preservative, as 0.5 per cent. phenol, tricresol,
etc., is added unless the vaccine is to be used up at
once. The amounts of culture, salt solution, etc., vary with
the purpose for which the vaccine is to be used, from one
or two agar slant cultures and a few cc. of solution, when a
single animal is to be treated, to bulk agar cultures and
liters of solution as in preparing antityphoid vaccine on a
large scale.</p>

<p>Agar surface cultures are used so that there will be as
little admixture of foreign protein as possible (see <a href="#CHAPTER_XXXI" class="int-ref">Anaphylaxis</a>,
p.&nbsp;289 <i>et seq.</i>). Normal saline solution is isotonic with
the body cells and hence is employed as the vehicle.</p>

<p><b>Lipovaccines.</b>&mdash;The suspension of bacteria in neutral oil
was first used by Le Moignac and Pinoy who gave the name
“lipovaccines” (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λιπος</span>&nbsp;=&nbsp;fat) to them. It was claimed
that the reaction following injection of these vaccines was
less severe than with saline vaccines in many instances;
also, that the bacteria were much more slowly absorbed.
For these two reasons it was hoped that much larger numbers
of bacteria could be injected at one dose and one injection
would suffice instead of three or more as ordinarily
used. The technique of preparation, standardization and
killing of the organisms has not as yet been sufficiently
well established to warrant the general substitution of lipovaccines
for ordinary saline suspensions.</p>

<p>Vaccines are either “<i class="term">autogenous</i>” or “<i class="term">stock</i>.” An “autogenous”
vaccine is a vaccine that is made from bacteria
derived from the individual or animal which it is desired to
vaccinate and contains not only the particular organism but
<a id="Page_285" class="pagenum" title="285"> </a>
the particular strain of that organism which is responsible
for the lesion. Stock vaccines are made up from organisms
like the infective agent in a given case but derived from
some other person or animal or from laboratory cultures.
Commercial vaccines are “stock” vaccines and are usually
“polyvalent” or even “mixed.” A “polyvalent” vaccine
contains several strains of the infective agent and a “mixed”
contains several different organisms.</p>

<p>Stock vaccines have shown their value when used as preventive
inoculations, notably so in typhoid fever in man,
anthrax and black-leg in cattle. The author is strongly
of the opinion, not only from the extended literature on the
subject, but also from his own experience in animal, and
especially in human cases, that stock vaccines are much
inferior and much more uncertain in their action when used
in the <i>treatment</i> of an infection, than are autogenous vaccines.
This applies particularly to those instances in which <i class="term">pneumococci</i>,
<i class="term">streptococci</i>, <i class="term">micrococci</i>, and <i class="term">colon bacilli</i> are the causative
agents but to others as well. The following are some
of the reasons for this opinion: The above organisms are
notoriously extremely variable in their virulence. While
there is no necessarily close connection between virulence
and antigenic property, yet since virulence is so variable, it
is rational to assume that antigenic property is also extremely
variable. Individuals vary just as much in susceptibility
and hence in reactive power, and generally speaking, an
individual will react better in the production of antibodies
to a stimulus to which he has been more or less subjected,
<i>i.e.</i>, to organisms derived from his own body.</p>

<p>In the preparation of a vaccine great care must be used
in heating so that the organisms are killed, but the <i class="term">antigens</i>
are not destroyed. Many of the enzymes present in bacteria,
especially the proteolytic ones, are not any more sensitive
to heat than are the antigens, hence are not destroyed
entirely. Therefore a vaccine kept in stock for a long time
gradually has some of its antigens destroyed by the uninjured
enzymes present with them, and so loses in potency.
Therefore in treating a given infection it is well to make up a
vaccine from the lesion, use three or four doses and if more
are necessary make up a new vaccine.</p>

<p><a id="Page_286" class="pagenum" title="286"> </a>
If the above statements are borne in mind and vaccines
are made and administered accordingly, the author is well
satisfied that much better results will be secured.</p>

<p>In accordance with the theory on which the use of vaccines
is based, <i>i.e.</i>, that they stimulate the body cells to
produce immunizing antibodies, it is clear that they are especially
suitable in those infections in which the process is
<em>localized</em> and should not be of much value in <em>general</em> infections.
In the latter case the cells of the body are stimulated
to produce antibodies by the circulating organisms, probably
nearly to their limit, hence the introduction of more of
the same organisms, capable of stimulating though dead, is
apt to overtax the cells and do more harm than good. It is
not possible to tell accurately when this limit is reached, but
the clinical symptoms are a guide. If vaccines are used at
all in general infections they should be given in the early
stages and in small doses at first with close watch as to the
effect. In localized infections only the cells in the immediate
neighborhood are much stimulated, hence the introduction
of a vaccine calls to their aid cells in the body generally,
and much more of the resulting antibodies are carried
to the lesion in question. Manifestly surgical procedures
such as incision, drainage, washing away of dead and necrotic
tissue with normal saline solution, not necessarily
antiseptics, will aid the antibodies in their action and are to
be recommended where indicated.</p>

<p>In the practical application of any remedy the <em>dosage</em> is
most important. Unfortunately there is no accurate method
of determining this with a vaccine. Wright recommended
determining the number of the organisms per cc. as before
mentioned, and his method or some modification of it is
still in general use. From what was said with regard to
variation, both in organisms and in individuals, it can be
seen that the number of organisms is at least only a very
rough guide. This is further illustrated by the doses of
micrococcus (staphylococcus) vaccines recommended by
different writers, which vary from 50,000,000 to 2,000,000,000
per cc. The author is decidedly of the opinion that
<em>there is no way of determining the dosage of a vaccine in the
<a id="Page_287" class="pagenum" title="287"> </a>
treatment of any given case except by the result of the first dose</em>.
Hence it is his practice to make vaccines of a particular
organism of the same approximate strength, and to give a
dose of a measured portion of a cubic centimeter, judging
the amount by what the individual or animal can apparently
withstand, without too violent a reaction. If there is no
local or general reaction or if it is very slight and there is no
effect on the lesion, the dose is too small. If there is a
violent local reaction with severe constitutional symptoms
clinically, and the lesion appears worse, the dose is too
large. There should be some local reaction and some
general, but not enough to cause more than a slight disturbance,
easy to judge in human subjects, more difficult in
animals. In cases suitable for vaccine treatment no <em>serious</em>
results should follow from a properly prepared vaccine,
though the process of healing may be delayed temporarily.
Wright claimed, and many have substantiated him, that
always following a vaccination there is a period when the
resistance of the animal is diminished. This is called the
“negative phase,” and Wright considered this to last as
long as the opsonic index remained low, and when this
latter began to increase the stage of the “positive” or
favorable phase was reached. As has been stated the opsonic
index is pretty generally regarded as of doubtful value,
though the existence of a period of lowered resistance is
theoretically probable from the fact that antibodies already
present in the blood will be partially used up in uniting with
the vaccine introduced and that the body cells are called
upon suddenly to do an extra amount of work and it takes
them some time to adapt themselves. This time, the
“negative phase,” is much better determined by the clinical
symptoms, general and especially local. It is good
practice to begin with a dose relatively small. The result
of this is an indication of the proper dosage and also prepares
the patient for a larger one. The second dose should
follow the first not sooner than three or four days, and
should be five to seven days if the first reaction is severe.
These directions are not very definite, but clinical experience
to date justifies them. It is worth the time and money
<a id="Page_288" class="pagenum" title="288"> </a>
to one who wishes to use vaccines to learn from one who
has had experience both in making and administering them,
and then to remember that each patient is an individual
case, for the use of vaccines as well as for any other kind of
treatment.</p>


<h4 id="AGGRESSIN">AGGRESSIN.</h4>

<p>Opsonins have been shown to be specific substances which
act on bacteria in such a way as to render them more readily
taken up by the leukocytes. By analogy one might
expect to find bacteria secreting specific substances which
would tend to counteract the destructive action of the
phagocytes and bactericidal substances. Bail and his co-workers
claim to have demonstrated such substances in
exudates in certain diseases and have given the distinctive
name “aggressins” to them. By injecting an animal with
“aggressins,” antiaggressins are produced which counteract
their effects and thus enable the bacteria to be destroyed.
The existence of such specific bodies is not generally accepted
as proved. The prevailing idea is that bacteria protect
themselves in any given case by the various toxic substances
that they produce, and that “aggressins” as a special class
of substances are not formed.</p>

ANAPHYLAXIS.</h3>


<p>Dallera, in 1874, and a number of physiologists of that
period, observed peculiar skin eruptions following the transfusion
of blood, that is, the introduction of foreign proteins.
In the years subsequent to the introduction of diphtheria
antitoxin (1890) characteristic “serum rashes” were not
infrequently reported, sometimes accompanied by more or
less severe general symptoms and occasionally death&mdash;a
train of phenomena to which the name “serum sickness”
was later applied, since it was shown that it was the horse
serum (foreign protein) that was the cause, and not the antitoxin
itself. In 1898 Richet and Hericourt noticed that
some of the dogs which they were attempting to immunize
against toxic eel serum not only were not immunized but
suffered even more severely after the second injection. They
obtained similar results with an extract of mussels which
contain a toxin. Richet gave the name “anaphylaxis”
(“no protection”) to this phenomenon to distinguish it
from immunity or prophylaxis (protection).</p>

<p>All the above-mentioned observations led to no special
investigations as to their cause. In 1903, Arthus noticed
abscess formation, necrosis and sloughing following several
injections of horse serum in immediately adjacent parts of
the skin in rabbits (“Arthus’ phenomenon”). Theobald
Smith, in 1904, observed the death of guinea-pigs following
properly spaced injections of horse serum. This subject
was investigated by Otto and by Rosenau and Anderson in
this country and about the same time von Pirquet and Schick
were making a study of serum rashes mentioned above. The
publications of these men led to a widespread study of the
subject of injections of foreign proteins. It is now a well-established
<a id="Page_290" class="pagenum" title="290"> </a>
fact that the injection into an animal of a foreign
protein&mdash;vegetable, animal or bacterial, simple or complex&mdash;followed
by a second injection after a proper length of time
leads to a series of symptoms indicating poisoning, which
may be so severe as to cause the death of the animal. Richet’s
term “anaphylaxis” has been applied to the condition
of the animal following the first injection and indicates that
it is in a condition of supersensitiveness for the protein in
question. The animal is said to be “sensitized” for that
protein.<a id="Marker_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="marker" title="Footnote 25">25</a> The sensitization is specific since an animal injected
with white of chicken’s egg reacts to a second injection
of chicken’s egg only and not pigeon’s egg or blood
serum or any other protein. The specific poisonous substance
causing the symptoms has been called “anaphylotoxin”
though what it is, is still a matter of investigation.
It is evident that some sort of an antibody results from the
first protein injected and that it is specific for its own antigen.</p>

<p>A period of ten days is usually the minimum time that
must elapse between the first and second injections in guinea-pigs
in order that a reaction may result, though a large primary
dose requires much longer. If the second injection is
made within less time no effect follows, and after three or
more injections at intervals of about one week the animal
fails to react at all, it has become “immune” to the protein.
Furthermore, after an animal has been sensitized by one
injection and has reacted to a second, then, if it does not
die from the reaction, it fails to react to subsequent injections.
In this latter case it is said to be “antianaphylactic.”</p>

<p>It must be remembered that proteins do not normally get
into the circulation except by way of the alimentary tract.
Here all proteins that are absorbed are first broken down
to their constituent amino-acids, absorbed as such and
these are built up into the proteins characteristic of the
animal’s blood. Hence when protein as such gets into the
blood it is a foreign substance to be disposed of. The blood
<a id="Page_291" class="pagenum" title="291"> </a>
contains proteolytic enzymes for certain proteins normally.
It is also true that the body cells possess the property of
digesting the proteins of the blood and building them up
again into those which are characteristic of the cell. Hence
it appears rational to assume that the foreign proteins act
as stimuli to certain cells to produce more of the enzymes
necessary to decompose them, so that they may be either
built up into cell structure or eliminated as waste. If in
this process of splitting up of protein a poison were produced,
then the phenomena of “anaphylaxis” could be
better understood. As a matter of fact Vaughan and his
co-workers have shown that by artificially splitting up proteins
from many different sources&mdash;animal, vegetable, pathogenic
and saprophytic bacteria&mdash;a poison <em>is produced</em> which
appears to be the same in all cases and which causes the
symptoms characteristic of anaphylaxis. On the basis of
these facts it is seen that anaphylaxis is simply another
variety of immunity. The <i>specific antibody</i> in this case is
an <i>enzyme</i> which decomposes the protein instead of precipitating
it. The enzyme must be specific for the protein
since these differ in constitution. Vaughan even goes so
far as to say that the poison is really the central ring common
to all proteins and that they differ only in the lateral
groups or side chains attached to this central nucleus. The
action of the enzyme in this connection would be to split
off the side chains, and since these are the specific parts of
the protein, the enzyme must be specific for each protein.
The pepsin of the gastric juice and the trypsin of the pancreas
split the native proteins only to peptones. As is well
known, these when injected in sufficient quantity give rise
to poisonous symptoms, and will also give rise to anaphylaxis
under properly spaced injections. They do not poison
normally because they are split by the intestinal erepsin to
amino-acids and absorbed as such. Whether Vaughan’s
theory of protein structure is the true one or not remains to
be demonstrated. It is not essential to the theory of anaphylaxis
above outlined, <i>i.e.</i>, a phenomenon due to the
action of specific <i>antibodies</i> which are enzymes. On physiological
grounds this appears the most rational of the few
<a id="Page_292" class="pagenum" title="292"> </a>
explanations of anaphylaxis that have been offered and was
taught by the author before he had read Vaughan’s theory
along the same lines.</p>

<p>On the basis of the author’s theory the phenomena of
protein immunity and antianaphylaxis may be explained in
the following way which the author has not seen presented.
The enzymes necessary to decompose the injected protein
are present in certain cells and are formed in larger amount
by those cells to meet the increased demand due to injection
of an excess of protein. They are retained in the cell for a
time at least. If a second dose of protein is given before the
enzymes are excreted from the cells as waste, this is digested
within the cells in the normal manner. If a third dose is
given, the cells adapt themselves to this increased intracellular
digestion and it thus becomes normal to them.
Hence the <i class="term">immunity</i> is due to this increased intracellular
digestion.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the second injection is delayed long
enough, then the <em>excess</em> enzyme, but not all, is excreted from
the cells and meets the second dose of protein in the blood
stream and rapidly decomposes it there, so that more or less
intoxication from the split products results. This uses up
<em>excess</em> enzyme, hence subsequent injections are not digested
in the blood stream but within the cells as before. So that
“antianaphylaxis” is dependent on the exhaustion of the
excess enzyme in the blood, and the condition is <em>fundamentally</em>
the same as protein immunity, <i>i.e.</i>, due to <i>intracellular</i>
digestion in each case.</p>

<p>As has been indicated “serum sickness” and sudden death
following serum injections are probably due to a sensitization
of the individual to the proteins of the horse in some
unknown way. Probably hay fever urticarial rashes and
idiosyncrasies following the ingestion of certain foods&mdash;strawberries,
eggs, oysters, etc., are anaphylactic phenomena.</p>

<p>In medical practice the reaction is used as a means of
diagnosis in certain diseases, such as the tuberculin test in
tuberculosis, the mallein test in glanders. The individual
or animal with tuberculosis becomes sensitized to certain
proteins of the tubercle bacillus and when these proteins in
<a id="Page_293" class="pagenum" title="293"> </a>
the form of tuberculin are introduced into the body a reaction
results, local or general, according to the method of
introduction. The practical facts in connection with the
tuberculin test are also in harmony with the author’s theory
of anaphylaxis as above outlined. Milder cases of tuberculosis
give more vigorous reactions because the intracellular
enzymes are not used up rapidly enough since the products
of the bacillus are secreted slowly in such cases. Hence
excess of enzyme is free in the blood and the injection of
the tuberculin meets it there and a vigorous reaction results.
In old, far-advanced cases, no reaction occurs, because the
enzymes are all used in decomposing the large amount of
tuberculous protein constantly present in the blood. The
fact that an animal which has once reacted fails to do so
until several months afterward likewise depends on the fact
that the <em>excess</em> enzyme is used in the reaction and time must
elapse for a further excess to accumulate.</p>

<p>The anaphylactic reaction has been made use of in the
identification of various types of proteins and is of very
great value since the reaction is so delicate, particularly
when guinea-pigs are used as test animals. Wells has
detected the 0.000,001 g. of protein by this test. It is evident
that the test is applicable in medico-legal cases and in
food examination and has been so used.</p>

<h4 class="smcap">Summary of Immunity as Applied to Protection
from Disease.</h4>

<p>The discussion of “immunity problems” in the preceding
chapters serves to show that protection from disease either
as a condition natural to the animal or as an acquired state
is dependent on certain properties of its body cells or fluids,
or both. The actual factors so far as at present known may
be summarized as follows:</p>

<p>1. <i class="term">Antitoxins</i> which neutralize true toxins; shown to exist
for very few diseases.</p>

<p>2. <i class="term">Cytolytic substances</i> which destroy the invading organism:
in reality two substances; amboceptor, which is specific,
and complement, the real dissolving enzyme.</p>

<p>3. <i class="term">Phagocytosis</i> or the destruction of the invading organisms
within the leukocytes.</p>

<p>4. <i class="term">Opsonins</i> which render the bacteria more readily taken
up by the phagocytes.</p>

<p>5. <i class="term">Enzymes</i> other than complement possibly play a part
in the destruction of some pathogenic organisms or their
products. This remains to be more definitely established.</p>

<p>6. It is possible that in natural immunity there might
be no receptors in the body cells to take up the organisms
or their products, or the receptors might be present in
certain cells but of a very low chemical affinity, so that combination
does not occur. It is even highly probable that
many substances formed by invading organisms which might
injure specialized cells, such as those of glandular, nervous
or muscle tissue, have a more rapid rate of reaction with, or
a stronger affinity for, lower unspecialized cells, such as connective
and lymphoid tissue, and unite with these so that
their effects are not noticed.</p>

<p>The importance of these different, factors varies in different
diseases and need not be considered in this connection.</p>

<p>The question “which of the body cells are engaged in the
production of antibodies” is not uncommonly asked. On
physiological grounds it would not seem reasonable that the
highly specialized tissues above mentioned could take up
this work, even though they are the ones which suffer the
<a id="Page_296" class="pagenum" title="296"> </a>
greatest injury in disease. Hence it is to be expected that
the lower or unspecialized cells are the source, and it has
been shown that the antibodies are produced by the phagocytes
(though not entirely as Metchnikoff maintained), by
lymphoid tissue generally, by the bone marrow and also by
connective-tissue cells, though in varying degrees.</p>

<p>Since immunity depends on the activity of the body cells
it is evident that one of the very best methods for avoiding
infectious diseases is to keep these cells up to their highest
state of efficiency, to keep in “good health.” Hence good
health means not only <em>freedom from disease</em> but also <em>protection
against disease</em>.</p>

The sulphur bacteria are partially prototrophic for S; probably the iron

The term “fermentation” was originally used to denote the process which
goes on in fruit juices or grain extracts when alcohol and gas are formed.
Later it was extended to apply to the decomposition of almost any organic
substance. In recent years the attempt has been made to give a chemical
definition to the word by restricting its use to those changes in which by
virtue of a “wandering” or rearrangement of the carbon atoms “new substances
are formed which are not constitutents of the original molecule.”
It may be doubted whether this restriction is justified or necessary. A
definition is at present scarcely possible except when the qualifying adjective
is included as “alcoholic fermentation,” “ammoniacal fermentation,” “lactic
acid <span class="no-wrap">fermentation,” etc.

It is probable that this is the way “Jack o’lanterns” or “Will o’ the wisps”
are ignited. Marsh gas is produced as above outlined from the vegetable
